<p>
	A note about breast size: The inch measurement is how many inches deep (from the flat of the chest) the breasts are,
	which is usually done by measuring the circumference around the body at the bust (farthest point of the boobs) and the 
	underbust (the flat part of the chest directly beneath the boobs), taking the difference, and then halving that value.
	So, C cups stick approximately 1.5 inches out from the underbust.
</p>
<p>
	A note about why the value is halved here: It is so that we can more easily visualize just how far out the boobs are.
