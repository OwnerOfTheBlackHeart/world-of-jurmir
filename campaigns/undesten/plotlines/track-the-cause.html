<h1>Track the Cause</h1>
<p>
    <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-grass-foot-tribe" hash="bonekeeper-ribwort">Bonekeeper Ribwort</ap-link-button> has started to note an
    outbreak of a disease with a magical aura to it. She doesn't know if finding and destroying the source will cure those already suffering
    from the disease, but it should prevent further spread, and so she would like an extra pair of hands to track down the source and deal with
    it.
