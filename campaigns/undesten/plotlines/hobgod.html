<h1>Hobgod</h1>
<p>
    <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-svala-vikardottir">Svala</ap-link-button> has been watching the activities of the local hobgoblin empire 
    and has notice something unnerving:
    There is a sect of hobgoblins that have dedicated themselves to creating a God of Goblins, preferably under their
    control. Having a god, even a minor one, behind them would make the hobgoblins an even worse threat than they
    already are, and would certainly make them far more bold.
