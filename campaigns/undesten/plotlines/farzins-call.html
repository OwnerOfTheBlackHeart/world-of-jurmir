<h1>Farzin's Call</h1>
<li>
    <b>Farzin's Journey:</b> During Farzin's time in the womb, her father, a mad kitsune abusing her
    mother's addictions, merged into a shard of a fae's soul into her. Farzin's aberrant side calls her
    to the Deadlands, and eventually to the lab of her father, due to his current experiments.
