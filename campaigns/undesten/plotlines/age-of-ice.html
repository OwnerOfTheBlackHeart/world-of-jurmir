<h1>Age of Ice</h1>
<p>
    Miri has discovered that something is causing creatures of cold to begin appearing in Undesten. There are also signs of winter coming,
    something that would be disastrous for Undesten. <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-ayaki">Sokhatai Ikaya</ap-link-button>,
    a shifter who worships the primordial Perform, is trying to prevent this as they believe
    that Perform loves nature and life, and that this terrible, heretical misuse of her power.
</p>
<p>
    <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-ragna-namkidottir">Ragna Namkidottir</ap-link-button>, a warpriest in service to the beheaded
    primordial, seeks to use the power of Perform to bring winter to Undesten, thus giving herself enough elemental energy to pull
    the Moon from the sky and reunite it with Perform's body, which she believes will end suffering, both of the god and of those who
    will be granted a quick death.
