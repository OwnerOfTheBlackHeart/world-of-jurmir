<h3 id="searching-for-slaves">Searching for Slaves</h3>
<p>
	While within settlements of Small Town, or larger, specific slaves can be sought out with a Diplomacy check. Before the check is rolled,
	the player can declare that they are looking for a slave of a specific class, race, sex and/or attractiveness range, with each selected
	criteria adding another +5 to the base 10 DC of the check. Slaves of a particularly high attractiveness, rare class or rare race can
	add up to an extra +10 to the DC of the check.
</p>
<p>
	Finding gestalt slaves can only be done within settlements of Small City, or larger, and add a +10 to the DC of the check. When looking
	for a specific classed gestalt character, each class must be searched for (or random), adding a +5 for each of the searched for classes.
	Gestalt slaves do not appear randomly in slave markets.
</p>

<h3 id="slave-xp-rates">Slave XP Rates</h3>
<p>
	Slaves with only NPC classes use the fast leveling XP chart, slaves with PC classes use the medium leveling XP chart and slaves with
	gestalt use the slow leveling XP chart.
</p>
<p>
	Slaves intending to level into a new category must reach the XP requirement of their next level in the XP chart of the new category.
	For example, a level 2 commoner who will be taking a level in rogue will need to gain enough XP to level to level 3 in the medium leveling
	XP chart.
</p>
<p>
	Gestalt slaves are a rare breed, and training a slave to become gestalt requires special resources and dedication. In order to be
	advanced into gestalt, a slave must XXX. <!-- TODO: Figure out the requirement to allow a slave to begin advancing as a gestalt -->
