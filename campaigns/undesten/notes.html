<h1>Undesten Businessman Notes</h1>
<h2 id="party-limitations">Party Limitations</h2>
<p>
	In order to keep the pace of combat from becoming a slog as a horde of PC characters outnumber and overpower
	even the largest of encounters, a max party size has been implemented. What counts as a party is a deployment of
	player controlled characters to accomplish a task, such as delving a dungeon or tracking down something valuable
	within a city. Multiple parties are capable of being deployed, but cannot participate in the same task without
	GM permission/override, such as if a player base is under seige or a pair of parties traveling together is
	ambushed.
</p>
<p>
	The maximum size of a party is 6 characters, 4 of which may be PC classed characters and 2 of which may be NPC classed
	characters. A number of restrictions and caveats exist:
</p>
<ul class="list">
	<li>An NPC classed character can take up a PC classed character slot if no NPC slots remain</li>
	<li>Up to 2 special summons, animal companions, or trained/reared animals may be placed within the first NPC slot</li>
	<li>Every special summon, animal companion, or trained/reared animal after the second takes up a full NPC slot</li>
	<li>Animals or summons not used in combat do not count against party size</li>
	<li>
		When the party is riding non-combat animals, or summons, and are ambushed, they start the battle riding their mounts,
		for better or worse, and may use their mounts for the encounter
	</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="searching-for-slaves">Searching for Slaves</h3>
<p>
	While within settlements of Small Town, or larger, specific slaves can be sought out with a Diplomacy check. Before the check is rolled,
	the player can declare that they are looking for a slave of a specific class, race, sex and/or attractiveness range, with each selected
	criteria adding another +5 to the base 10 DC of the check. Slaves of a particularly high attractiveness, rare class or rare race can
	add up to an extra +10 to the DC of the check.
</p>
<p>
	Finding gestalt slaves can only be done within settlements of Small City, or larger, and add a +10 to the DC of the check. When looking
	for a specific classed gestalt character, each class must be searched for (or random), adding a +5 for each of the searched for classes.
	Gestalt slaves do not appear randomly in slave markets.
</p>

<h3 id="slave-xp-rates">Slave XP Rates</h3>
<p>
	Slaves with only NPC classes use the fast leveling XP chart, slaves with PC classes use the medium leveling XP chart and slaves with
	gestalt use the slow leveling XP chart.
</p>
<p>
	Slaves intending to level into a new category must reach the XP requirement of their next level in the XP chart of the new category.
	For example, a level 2 commoner who will be taking a level in rogue will need to gain enough XP to level to level 3 in the medium leveling
	XP chart.
</p>
<p>
	Gestalt slaves are a rare breed, and training a slave to become gestalt requires special resources and dedication. In order to be
	advanced into gestalt, a slave must meet four requirements:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>The slave must gain enough experience to reach the next level on the slow leveling chart</li>
	<li>The slave must have completed a heroic or mythic achievement, or consume/absorb a powerful magical spark</li>
	<li>The slave must have access to training or training materials for the second class(es) they are taking</li>
	<li>The slave master can have no more than 1 gestalt character per 5 pc classed or 10 npc classed slaves</li>
</ol>
<p>
	After meeting these requirements, the slave must spend 1 month mastering their second class. During this time, the slave cannot level
	and must focus at least 8 hours a day on training. Interruption delays the training by 1 extra day per day interrupted, meaning that
	a single day of interruption adds 2 total days to the training time requirement.
