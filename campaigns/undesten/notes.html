<h3 id="searching-for-slaves">Searching for Slaves</h3>
<p>
	While within settlements of Small Town, or larger, specific slaves can be sought out with a Diplomacy check. Before the check is rolled,
	the player can declare that they are looking for a slave of a specific class, race, sex and/or attractiveness range, with each selected
	criteria adding another +5 to the base 10 DC of the check. Slaves of a particularly high attractiveness, rare class or rare race can
	add up to an extra +10 to the DC of the check.
