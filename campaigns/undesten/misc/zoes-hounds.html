<h1>Zoe's Hounds</h1>
<p>
    For reasons and through means currently unknown, the private forces of Zoe Von Nalbalgrab have managed to reach Undesten.
    At present, their actions have been minimal, avoiding local populations and scouting around the Desertside and Deadlands.
</p>
<p>
    When rolling sex for a member of the Heck's Hounds, start by rolling a D3. On a 1, roll sex normally. On a 2 or a 3, they are
    a feminine hermaphrodite.
</p>

<h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2>
<p>
    Zoe's response to finding the portal to Undesten has been a muted affair. The deployed force is small, with only two 3 man cells
    in camo twin fangs to serve as the heavy hitters with the rest of the deployed units being recon forces. The recon team is lead
    by Asukai Hatsu, the fox-girl summoner, and Woya the Dragonguard commander. Hank has been informed and has also informed
    Letia Pretre, his tamed lamia red lady, and Dame Angele Desmarais, the dragon dame.
</p>
<p>
    Heck's Hounds are trying to establish a base and a covert means of generating an army, as well as working to establish a secure
    location for housing their forces.
</p>
<p>
    Hank is interested in running experiments on how Letia handles the realm and also... MAGIC!
