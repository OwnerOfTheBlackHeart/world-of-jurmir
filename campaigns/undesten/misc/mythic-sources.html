<h1>Mythic Sources</h1>
<p>
    Mythic power can come from many sources: Shards of divine energy, arcane experiments, prayers to the mythic being,
    unlocking some true potential and anything that can cause a normal person to suddenly become something legendary.
</p>

<h2 id="sources">Sources</h2>
<h3 id="godsoul">Godsoul</h3>
<p>
    While the Iryu Clan of the Voksit Empire has abandoned their project to create an artificial god, some fragments
    of knowledge from it remain. Specifically how to artificially cause a creature's soul to become a Godsoul,
    granting them something close to demi-godhood.

<h3 id="red-king">Red King</h3>
<p>
    The Red King is a dark, dangerous power that few would willingly contact, but those that manage to make contact... and
    survive such contact, rarely with their sanity intact, end up... changed. Those who manage to avoid being transformed into
    an aberration or a red lady do so by instead stealing the Red King's power for their own use.

    <p>
        While the Iryu Clan of the Voksit Empire has abandoned their project to create an artificial god, some fragments
        of knowledge from it remain. Specifically how to artificially cause a creature's soul to become a Godsoul,
        granting them something close to demi-godhood.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mythic heroes of the Godsoul variety tend to be the most "standard" mythic heroes, the power of their Godsoul
        so closely mimicking divine favor... because it is divine favor from withing themselves. Those who focus on the
        Godsoul within them can offer potent support to themselves and their allies, though the Godsoul within them does
        not guide them in any particular way. It simply is a part of them.
    </p>

    <h4 id="godsoul-requirements">Requirements</h4>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>To have a body magically strong enough to house a Godsoul</li>
        <li>To undergo the Godsoul ritual</li>
    </ul>

    </p>

    <h5 id="divine-presence">Divine Presence (Su)</h5>
    <p>
        Mythic characters of at least 1rd tier who gain mythic power from a Godsoul can select Divine Presence.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can expend 2 uses of mythic power as a swift action to unleash your divine presence. This is treated as casting
        the spell Prayer with a caster level equal to your character level and a duration of a number of rounds equal to your
        mythic tier. Divine Presence ignores spell resistance from non-mythic creatures.
    </p>

    <h5 id="restore-gifts">Restore Gifts (Su)</h5>
    <p>
        Mythic characters of at least 3rd tier who gain mythic power from a Godsoul can select Restore Gifts.
    </p>
    <p>
        You serve as a local source of divine power. By expending a use of mythic power, you can restore one of the following to a
        single creature within 30 feet:
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>A spell slot of a level equal to, or less than, your mythic tier that comes from a divine class (such as cleric or druid)</li>
        <li>A number of uses of Channel Energy equal to your mythic tier divided by 2 (minimum 1)</li>
        <li>A number of uses of Lay on Hands equal to your mythic tier</li>
        <li>A number of uses of Ki equal to your mythic tier divided by 2 (minimum 1)</li>
        <li>A number of uses of Wild Shape equal to your mythic tier divided by 2 (minimum 1)</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 id="divine-bullshit-go">Divine Bullshit Go! (Sp)</h5>
    <p>
        Mythic characters of at least 6rd tier who gain mythic power from a Godsoul can select Divine Bullshit Go.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can cast any divine spell from the cleric or druid spell list by expending a number of uses of mythic power equal to the spell level
        the spell. You do not need to know this spell or have it prepared. Your caster level for the sake of this spell is equal to your total hid dice
        plus your mythic tier and you are treated as having the Eschew Materials feat for the sake of casting the spell. The spell must be of a spell 
        level no more than your mythic tier. You can apply any metamagic feats you have, adjusting the level of the spell as normal for the metamagic
        feats chosen.
    </p>

    <h3 id="red-king">Red King</h3>
    <p>
        The Red King is a dark, dangerous power that few would willingly contact, but those that manage to make contact... and
        survive such contact, rarely with their sanity intact, end up... changed. Those who manage to avoid being transformed into
        an aberration or a red lady do so by instead stealing the Red King's power for their own use.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mythic heroes of the Red King are considered to be especially dangerous. They willingly contacted the Red King and survived, a feat in and of itself.
        Their connection to the Red King makes them even more deadly than a normal mythic hero and those that focus on the Red King's power within them
        can even exert their power over aberrations.
    </p>

    <h4 id="red-king-requirements">Requirements</h4>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Be capable of bearing children</li>
        <li>Have made contact with the Red King</li>
        <li>Either purposefully stolen the Red King's power or survived the encounter without being transformed</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="red-king-requirements">Alterations</h4>
    <p>
        The Red King mythic source alters or removes the following Base Mythic Abilities: Hard to Kill, Surge, Amazing Initiative, Force of Will.
        Instead, they gain the following Base Mythic Abilities in their place:
    </p>

    <h5 id="harder-to-kill">Harder to Kill (Ex)</h5>
    <p>
        Whenever you’re below 0 hit points, you automatically stabilize without needing to attempt a Constitution check. If you have an ability that allows 
        you to act while below 0 hit points, you still lose hit points for taking actions, as specified by that ability. Bleed damage still causes you to 
        lose hit points when below 0 hit points. In addition, you don’t die until your total number of negative hit points is equal to or greater than 
        triple your Constitution score. When you are below a total number of negative hit points equal to your Constitution score, you gain Fast Healing
        equal to your mythic tier, except it can only heal up to a total number of negative hit points equal to your Constitution score.
    </p>
    <p>
        This ability replaces Hard to Kill.
    </p>

    <h5 id="red-king-surge">Surge (Su)</h5>
    <p>
        Your surge dice are reduced by one stage. 1d4 at 1st tier, 1d6 at 4th tier, 1d8 at 7th tier, and 1d10 at 10th tier.
    </p>
    <p>
        This ability modifies Surge.
    </p>

    <h5 id="aberrant-aura">Aberrant Aura (Ex)</h5>
    <p>
        At 2nd, aberrations recognize you as one of their own. All aberrations have a starting attitude of indifferent, as per the diplomacy skill, 
        and will not willingly attack you unless provoked, such as by attacking them or stealing from them. For allies within 30 feet of you, aberrations have a starting
        attitude of unfriendly and generally won't attack, if the allies keep their distance and remain respectful.
    </p>
    <p>
        This ability replaces Amazing Initiative.
    </p>

    <h5 id="god-killer">God Killer</h5>
    <p>
        At 7th tier, any non-god creature you kill dies permanently, including lichs and mythic heroes with the Immortal mythic ability. They cannot be
        return to life by any means. If you killed a god's avatar, the god no longer has access to that avatar and it can never return to life. If you
        killed the god in their true form, the god is dead and can never return to life, however any avatars and other fragments of the god's power remain
        and become independent. These avatars and fragments of the god can no longer combine together on their own, and will fight with everything they
        have to avoid such a fate, as they view it as equal to being killed.
    </p>
    <p>
        This ability replaces Force of Will.
    </p>

    <br/>
    <br/>
    <p>
        Mythic characters with the Red King mythic source gain access to the following Path Abilities:
    </p>

    <p>
        Mythic characters of at least 1st tier who gain mythic power from the Red King can select Boon of the Aberrant.
    </p>
    <p>
        All aberrations under your command gain a sacred bonus to their Strength, Dexterity and Constitution equal to half of your mythic tier, rounding up.
        This applies to both summoned and controlled aberrations.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a standard action, you can expend a use of mythic power to grant an aberration under your command, within 10 feet per mythic tier, an enhancement bonus to 
        Strength, Dexterity and Constitution equal to your mythic tier for 1 minute.
    </p>

    <h5 id="improved-aberromancer">Improved Aberromancer (Ex)</h5>

    </p>
    <p>
        All abilities you gain from the Dread Aberromancer prestige class treat your level as equal to the base class level plus the Dread Aberromancer levels plus
        your mythic tier, including the maximum hit dice the Rebuke/Command Aberration ability and Command Aberration spell can affect. Improved Aberromancer does 
        not grant access to abilities from the Dread Aberromancer class beyond your current Dread Aberromancer level, nor does it improve your spell casting or 
        spells per day, with the exception of the Summon Aberration spell which adds your mythic tier to its caster level.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you do not meet the requirements of the Dread Aberromancer prestige class and take Improved Aberromancer, you can take levels in the Dread Aberromancer
        class; However, you do not gain the normal benefit of Improved Aberromancer unless you meet the requirements for the Dread Aberromancer prestige class.
    </p>

    <h5 id="maximized-aberromancer">Maximized Aberromancer (Ex)</h5>

    </p>
    <p>
        You double the number of hit dice of aberrations you can command with the Rebuke/Command Aberration ability, the Command Aberration spell and the
        Leadership feat. The bonus from Improved Aberromancer mythic ability is added before the doubling, if you have it. The maximum hit dice of a single
        aberration you control are not increased by Maximized Aberromancer. The maximum level of and number of cohorts you gain from Leadership are unaffected
        by Maximized Aberromancer.
