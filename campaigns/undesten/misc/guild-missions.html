    gnolls are the primary one which must be dealt with.

    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    While the lizardfolk are theoretically more amicable to other races living in their swamps, they are highly territorial and
    must either be killed or cowed if settlement is to begin. 
</p>

<h3 id="secure-hex">Maintain Hex Security (one hex)</h3>
<p>
    <b>Success DC:</b> 20<br/>
    <b>Required Successes:</b> 1<br/>

    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    Until the settlement within a hex is Small Town or larger, they will be incapable of defending themselves from gnolls and
    lizardfolk. Supplemental support in maintaining the security of their controlled area and the regular culling of threats
    are required to prevent attack.
</p>
<p>
    This mission must be performed once per month on any controlled, dangerous hex (savannah or swamp), or the settlement will
    come under attack and possibly be destroyed.

</p>
<p>
    Until the settlement within a hex is Small Town or larger, they will be incapable of defending themselves from gnolls and
    lizardfolk. Supplemental support in maintaining the security of their controlled area and the regular culling of threats
    are required to prevent attack.
</p>
<p>
    This mission must be performed once a month to remove gnoll attacks from the hexes between the dock for the Grassfoot Tribe
    and the Grassfoot tribe. If not performed, the hexes are counted as Dangerous and are unsuitable for regular commerce.

<h3 id="profitable-slave-trading">Profitable Slave Trading</h3>

    <b>Success DC:</b> 18<br/>
    <b>Required Successes:</b> 5<br/>
    <b>Travel Time:</b> 0 days<br/>
    <b>Activity Time:</b> 1 days<br/>
    <b>Rewards:</b> 250xp and 1,000gp plus 10gp for every point rolled above the success DC<br/>

</p>
<p>
    Slave trading, while a profitable business, requires savvy trades and the utilization of a carefully curated network.
    Assigning personnel to operate the business and forge and maintain connections goes a long way to keeping things afloat.
</p>
<p>
    This is a relatively safe and unrushed task, allowing the party to Take 10 on the Success DC.

    Utilizing the Bath of Ilvith it is possible to improve the aesthetic value of a slave. If the means by which this are
    done are kept quiet, or it is carefully done to slaves who have been purchased with intent to resell, the secret of the
    Bath of Ilvith can be prevented from becoming public knowledge.
