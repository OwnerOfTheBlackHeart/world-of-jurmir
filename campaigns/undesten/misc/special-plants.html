<h1>Special Plants</h1>
<p>
    Some plants offer effects beyond those of normal, mundane medicines or poisons. These valuable plants maybe magical
    or just alchemically potent, but the effect is the same: They do what other plants cannot.
</p>
<p>
    Once a special plant is found, it can be grown in a special garden with the same cost, time and size as the Farmland room from
    the downtime rules, except that instead of earnings it produces the special plant as per the special plant's Grow Rate.

<h2 id="plants">Plants</h2>
<h3 id="bladeleaf">Bladeleaf</h3>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 10gp per dose</p>
<p><b>Grow Rate:</b> 1 dose per day</p>
<p>
    Bladeleaf is a small, simple bush with leaves that have razor sharp edges. While unable to cause more harm than a paper cut, the
    bladeleaf plant is still prized by soldiers and warriors. When the leaves are ground into a powder and allowed to fully dissolve
    into boiling water, it creates a tea-like drink that helps a warrior stay focused.
</p>
<p>
    Consuming a dose of bladeleaf grants a +1 moral bonus to attack rolls for 12 hours.
</p>

<h3 id="catbite">Catbite</h3>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 10gp per dose</p>
<p><b>Grow Rate:</b> 1 dose per day</p>
<p>
    Catbite is a small, thorny bush with flowers that look like a cat's eye and white thorns that look like their teeth. Stripping
    the thorns from the bush, they can be powdered and mixed with water and flower, they can produce a foul tasting paste the consistency
    of yogurt. Those warriors capable of handling the flavor of catbite paste keep it in leather "vials" that they can quickly decork and
    slurp down like a potion and unleash that little bit more of their strength upon their enemies.
</p>
<p>
    Consuming a dose of catbite grants a +2 moral bonus to damage rolls with melee weapons for 2 hours.
</p>

<h3 id="keert">Keert</h3>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 15gp per dose</p>
<p><b>Grow Rate:</b> 5 days per dose</p>
<p>
    Keert is a fast growing, if picky, flower whose leaves can be pickled, then mixed into a paste, to create a simple salve that helps
    one heal and draws away toxins on the skin. Not well known among healers, those with access to keert like to keep small stockpiles
    for dealing with poison ivy and lacerations.
</p>
<p>
    Using a dose of keert paste as part of a Heal skill check grants a +2 circumstance bonus to Provide First aid, Provide Long-term care,
    Treat wounds, Treat deadly wounds and Treat poison if the poison is a contact or injury poison.
</p>

<h3 id="rock-apple">Rock Apple</h3>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 20gp per dose</p>
<p><b>Grow Rate:</b> 7 days per dose</p>
<p>
    Rock apples are a strange breed of tree that has adapted to grow in caves and mines. Rare in nature, dwarves frequently plant these
    trees in their mines to keep as snacks while working. Few realize that the hard, stone-flavored fruit aids in fortifying their bodies
    against the dust and disease of the mines. While dwarves are willing to fight over what mines produce the best tasting rock apples,
    copper mines have the greatest number of supporters.
</p>
<p>
    Eating a full rock apple provides a +2 circumstance bonus on Fortitude saves against disease and airborne poisons.
</p>

<h3 id="revenant-grass">Revenant Grass</h3>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 150gp per dose</p>
<p><b>Grow Rate:</b> 28 days per dose</p>
<p>
    A dark, short grass that smells like death and grows best around undead, revenant grass is considered to be a rare treat by orcs,
    who dry the grass before mixing it with tobacco and smoking it from a pipe. Those who know about its use to stave off death instead
    mix fresh picked revenant grass with various fruits and vegetables to take the edge of the grass's flavor, then lard and wax the
    concoction to preserve it and make a single dose last longer.
</p>
<p>
    Chewing on a dose of revenant grass allows a creature to remain Disabled, instead of dying, until -10 hit points and grants a +2
    alchemy bonus to Constitution checks to stabilize.
