    The ancient ruins are from the time of Steele and were great works of the dwarves trying to build mountains

    war with the <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button> have rotted away. The arcane
    magics have corrupted the lands around them while what clockwork still functions poses a danger to anyone
    fool enough to place themselves willingly around it.
