    The ancient ruins are from the time of Steele and were great works of the dwarves trying to build mountains
    artificially. The ancient arcane magics and clockwork machines that weren't outright destroyed during the
    war with the <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button> have rotted away. The arcane
    magics have corrupted the lands around them while what clockwork still functions poses a danger to anyone
    fool enough to place themselves willingly around it.
