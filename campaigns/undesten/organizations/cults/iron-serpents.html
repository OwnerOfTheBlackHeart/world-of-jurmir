<h1>Iron Serpents</h1>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    The Iron Serpents is not a specific single cult, but rather a collection of coordinated cults of closely related deities with the same goals,
    namely the replacement of the current pantheon with gods of their own.
    The gods of these cults are reptilian or serpentine, mysterious, manipulative and power hungry, with more than one cult among the Iron Serpents
    collecting a number of serpent gods into their own unique pantheons.
</p>
<p>
    The Iron Serpents, being as decentralized as they are, very from cult to cult. They can be organized, rigid and martial, chaotic with influence
    based off magical power, friendly with social status determining influence, or anything inbetween. What is shared is the veneration of snakes, 
    lizards and drakes, especial those that live in the desert, and the objective of replacing the New Gods with serpent gods. The vast majority of
    Iron Serpent cults are led by a Scaled Chosen, a servant of their god(s) who has been converted into a serpentfolk by deific intervention, with
    the largest cults having multiple Scaled Chosen, who coordinate as often as they compete. Serving directly under the Scaled Chosen are the priests
    of the cults, who are charged with carrying out the will of the gods and the Scaled Chosen, as well as teaching the common cultist the faith.
    Everything below the priests depends on the cult itself, following whatever structure their god(s) and Scaled Chosen deem best.
