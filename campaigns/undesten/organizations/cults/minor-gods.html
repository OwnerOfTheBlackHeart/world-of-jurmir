                The Queen of the Sands appears as a beautiful woman with a shiny, black scorpion as her lower body. She wears no
                clothing, save a pair of horns, with some the more modest depictions using her long black hair to cover her breasts.
                She is normally depicted as carrying a staff with red wrappings.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Queen of the Sands holds a regal, but cold, manner about her.
