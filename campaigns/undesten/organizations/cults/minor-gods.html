            territory.

            <p>
                Lolth appears as a massive, 15 foot tall drider with a black widow's body and a beautiful, purple female drow's torso dressed in finery of
                gold, spider silk and leather. She is normally depicted wielding powerful magics. Despite her attractive appearance, Lolth is resoundingly 
                cruel and malicious, and no true worshiper of Lolth expects to maintain her gifts if they are cease to be useful to her or otherwise earn
                her vindictive wrath.
            </p>
            <p>
                The most well known story of Lolth is when she revealed herself to the drow. Lolth arrived in the drow city of Julithron'ikan (commonly called
                Jikan by non-elves), proclaiming herself to be the first sane drider, then demanding that the drow of Julithron'ikan submit and accept her as
                their queen or she would turn them into driders like her. When the drow inevitably denied her and called upon 
                <ap-link-button linkName="sithrak">Sithrak</ap-link-button>, the god told the god to ignore her and focus on keeping the
                <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button> contained. Infuriated by the lack of response from the drow, Lolth extracted her
                own venom and dumped it into each of their wells. With the drows' god ignoring them, the drow of Julithron'ikan rapidly ran out of clean water
                and resorted to drinking the poisoned water. As the drow began to whither and suffer from her poison, Lolth climbed over the city wall and attacked,
                capturing those who put up a good fight against her into driders to serve as her army while gorging on those she viewed as only having value
                as food, slowly growing in size as she devoured her way through Julithron'ikan until she reached her current size.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now 15 feet tall and having an army of driders at her back, Lolth arrived next at the city of Yuvnur'vrenti. This time, instead of demanding to
                be queen, she demanded they worship her as a god.
