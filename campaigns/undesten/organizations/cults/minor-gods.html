            Yvette is a 9 out of 10 female silverwolf standing 8 feet tall with long, flowing silver hair, ice blue eyes, pale skin and D cup titties.

        <p>
            Yvette is a focused individual who is curious and observant, but always ready for violence. While she seeks their knowledge, Yvette otherwise
            has little interest in those who are not a part of <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-zoes-hounds">Heck's Hounds</ap-link-button>,
            unless they possess sufficiently advanced technology.
