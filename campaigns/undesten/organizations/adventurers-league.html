<h1>Adventurers' League</h1>
<p>
    The Adventurers' League is a guild spanning Undesten with the job of supporting, monitoring and regulating monster hunting and ruin
    raiding. The Adventurers' League has close ties with both the Shah and the Dwarven Kings, and does not hide its influence nor the
    influence of the governments on it, though the Adventurers League endeavors to use the plentiful money that the two governments
    provide it to provide as attractive services to adventurers as possible to bring them within its influence. Providing adventurers for
    expeditions into the deep desert or wastes is a similarly common service provided by the Adventurers' League.

<p>
    The Adventurers' League has headquarters in both <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-shehar">Shehar</ap-link-button>
    and XXX, which draw in masses of adventurers and serve many as their bases of operations.

<h2 id="tiers">Tiers</h2>
<p>
    The Adventurers League breaks both adventurers and quests into 5 tiers (mechanically corresponding to APL increments of 4). By League
    rules, an adventurer is not allowed to take quests above their tier or more than one tier below them without party composition exceptions,
    such as a tier 4 adventurer taking a group of tier 1 adventurers on a tier 2 quest.
