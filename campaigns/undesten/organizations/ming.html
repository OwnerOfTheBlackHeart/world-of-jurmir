    The Ming is an elvish empire that claims Undesten as a vassal state, though beyond scattered holdings,
    the Ming struggle to enforce their power or taxes over the peoples of Undesten. While ruled by an 
    emperor who is highly involved with high level administration, the day to day operations of the Ming
    are handled by the Six Ministries: Personnel, Revenue, Rites, War, Justice and Public Works. In order
    to keep the servants and leadership of the Six Ministries in line, the emperor employs the Censorate.
    Emperor Zhen Xinyi has served as the emperor of the Ming for nearly 200 years, during which he has
    been consolidating power, streamlining the Ming government, and expanding the influence of the Ming.

<p>
    The Ministry of Personnel is in charge of maintaining censuses of both the government and of the people,
    as well as identifying and tracking potentially valuable administrators. However, what most of the Ming
    consider to be the most important duty of the Ministry of Personnel is the handling of payroll and
    benefits for government administrators.

<p>
    The Ministry of Revenue is in charge of what its name implies: The collection of taxes. It is also tasked
    with arresting tax evaders, verifying the finances of the other ministries, paying contractors, hunting down
    financial theft, and tracking the contributions of vassals.
</p>
<p>
    The Ministry of Rites is charged with the management of shrines and churches throughout the Ming's territory,
    maintaining faith in the Ming's gods, and managing minor deities, whether through appeasement or removal.
    Within the past half century, the Ministry of Rites has also taken on the responsibility of regulating and 
    supporting magic among the Ming.
</p>
<p>
    The Ministry of War is in charge of maintaining and training the armies of the Ming, establishing military tactics,
    implementing new military doctrine, monitoring potential reserves of conscripts and monitor the military capability
    of foreign powers. Roughly two centuries ago the Five Commissions of the Military were consolidated under the Ministry 
    of War to improve the Ming's ability to power project by consolidating the military under a single command.
</p>
<p>
    The Ministry of Justice is in charge of enforcing law and order upon the citizens of the Ming. City guards,
    criminal inquisitors and judges all report to the Ministry of Justice. Among the citizens of the Ming, the
    Ministry of Justice is the most feared, followed closely by the Ministry of Revenue.
</p>
<p>
    The Ministry of Public Works is in charge of managing the public works of the Ming, from road networks and
    city planning to water access and farmland assignment. As a quirk of the fact that a majority of the Ming's fortresses
    are built for government use, the Ministry of Public Works builds, operates and maintains all non-privately owned
    fortresses used by the Ministry of War.
</p>
<p>
    Officially, the Censorate is in charge of surveying and assessing the work of Ming officials, ensuring they
    maintain a minimum quality of work and limiting corruption to acceptable levels. Unofficially, the Censorate
    has grown substantially in power under the current Emperor, becoming his personal internal intelligence agency,
    especially among vassals and colonies. The Censorate has even been tasked with performing special missions in
    other nations where the Emperor's guard would not be welcome.
