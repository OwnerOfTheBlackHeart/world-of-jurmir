    The scrap-barge hamlet of Jijig is built around a small series of solar water purifiers and a pair of lime trees. An artificial rice patty
    also serves to help feed Jijig as well as various personal fishing boats.

<p>
    Raha is a 10 out of 10 female drow with C cup titties, pink eyes and ass length pale-lavender hair. She normally wears tight, revealing drow
    leathers with delicate silver jewelry and several blood-red rubies. Raha is a tyrant and rules Jijig with an iron fist, ensuring that any who
    work her rice fields are utilized fully and any beyond them remember their place.
