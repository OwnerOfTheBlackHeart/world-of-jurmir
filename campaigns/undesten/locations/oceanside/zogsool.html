<p>
    Built not far off of the Bloodfloat River, Zogsool is a series of large, anchored docks for both ocean and river faring vessels.
    The town itself, while quite large for a junk float, is not particularly surprising for those familiar with Oceanside. The core of
    Zogsool's economy comes from the exchange of goods from oceanic vessels transferring cargo to river boats, and the services provided
    to the crew of the variety of ships and boats that moor in its docks.
