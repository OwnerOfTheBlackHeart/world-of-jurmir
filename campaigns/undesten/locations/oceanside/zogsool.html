<p>
    Built not far off of the Bloodfloat River, Zogsool is a series of large, anchored docks for both ocean and river faring vessels.
    The town itself, while quite large for a junk float, is not particularly surprising for those familiar with Oceanside. The core of
    Zogsool's economy comes from the exchange of goods from oceanic vessels transferring cargo to river boats, and the services provided
    to the crew of the variety of ships and boats that moor in its docks.

<h2 id="organizations-and-monsters">Organizations and Monsters</h2>
<h3 id="sahar-guild">Sahar Guild</h3>
<p>
    The Sahar Guild is a guild of druids in charge of keeping the winds and waters surrounding Zogsool calm. While they technically have no
    legal power within Zogsool, the import of their task gives the Guild considerable sway and the leadership of the Sahar Guild is well
    liked enough that most people and guards around Zogsool put more stock into their word than those of the local aristocracy.

<h2 id="notable-locations">Notable Locations</h2>
<h3 id="open-crate">The Open Crate</h3>
<p>
    A large, square scrap building with an open shipping crate for a sign, the Open Crate is the largest inn in Zogsool, complete with attached bar.
    The inside of the building starts with the bar, a large open room with a iron heater burning dried seaweed and scattered tables with the bar dominating
    the back of the room while maintaining a commanding view of the room. Beside the bar is a hallway and a staircase, with the hallway leading to
    4 rentable planning rooms. The staircase leads to a second floor with a collection of shared and personal bedrooms for rent, while on the third floor
    are the 5 suite rooms.
</p>
<p>
    The Open Crate is owned by <a href="#siban-ger">Siban Ger</a> and <a href="#fazel-ger">Fazel Ger</a>. During the day, <a href="#fazel-ger">Fazel</a>
    runs the bar while <a href="#siban-ger">Siban</a> takes over at night.
</p>

<h3 id="sabres-and-nails">Sabres and Nails</h3>
<p>
    Made from carefully assembled scrap metal plates, almost as if advertising their skill with metal via the very skin of their building, Sabres and
    Nails offers a counter built into the wall that allows potential customers to view, but not touch, their collection of sabres and nails, valuable
    goods for passing ships. A simple sign states that other ironworks can be made to order.
</p>

<h3 id="keshmart">Keshmart</h3>
<p>
    A strange, white painted building that sticks out from the rest of the scrap float in the consistency of its construction and the large, open space
    within it. The inside of the building is like walking into a farmers' market stacked on top of another farmers' market, offering nearly every type
    of food grown in Undesten, and even some grown elsewhere, as well as offering many styles of premade clothes and tools. The people working the
    various registers speak in a friendly manner, but are clearly done with life. A sign states "Please don't feed other shoppers."
</p>
<p>
    Keshmart is open 24/7.
</p>

<h3 id="banded-bagh">The Banded Bagh</h3>
<p>
    A building utilizing a large glass pane as the front of the store, allowing those outside to look in and see the various manikins draped in leather,
    cloth and armor. The premier source of soft armors, and even some metal armors, the Banded Bagh also handles normal clothing, though they mostly do
    custom order and resizing/adjusting work.
</p>

<h3 id="gallows">The Gallows</h3>
<p>
    Made up of a single stand with 6 gallows poles lined up one after the other, this macabre stage does serve the city in its clear role as a place
    to hang criminals, but when not in use by the local guards, the slave market takes over. The stage, with its large, raised, easily visible surface and
    sturdy gallows are an excellent place for tying up valuable slaves who are for sale. Businesses selling collars, whips and the like are scattered around
    the plaza surrounding the gallows. 
</p>

<h3 id="ming-embassy">Ming Embassy</h3>
<p>
    Standing distinct from the other buildings among the scrap island, the Ming Embassy is built on a raised mound of scrap with brightly
    painted wooden pillars holding up three layers of stepped, ceramic tiled awnings with a thin walled wooden building, including woven wood strip
    windows, coated in a layer of bright red and white using a lapis blue for highlights. The inside of the building is lavish, with silk cushioned,
    wooden furniture and jade statues, separated by woven bamboo walls adorned with fine tapestries. The office of the prefect is clearly
    labeled and sits as the grandest of them all.
