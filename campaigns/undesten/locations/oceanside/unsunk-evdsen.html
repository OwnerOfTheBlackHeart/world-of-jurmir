<h1>Unsunk Evdsen</h1>
<p>
    The remains of the Evdsen, a warship that sank with all hands nearly 4 decades ago, has risen back to the surface. While a prize
    of this kind would normally attract a host of salvagers and scavengers looking for easy materials, the delay of its rising and the
    lack of an explanation for its return has worded off the heavily superstitious groups.

        The wreck of the Evdsen is populated by gillmen and merfolk who are aggressive to anyone who trespasses on what they view as
        their property.
