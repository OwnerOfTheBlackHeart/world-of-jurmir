<p>
    The town of Khuuk is built upon a great coral reef, with much of the town being either carved into the coral spires or
    made from coral harvest at the top of the spires, with the rest being made of whatever wood and metal has ended up
    getting caught within the reef, making extraction easy. Khuuk has very little in the way of resource production, making
    most of its money from processing goods and serving as a secondary trading hub for passing merchants and scrapships that
    wish to avoid the bureaucracy and laws of <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-wavescraper" inline>Wavescraper</ap-link-button>.
