<p>
    Jutting out of the ocean, Wavescraper is a city built in and around the remains of a sunken skyscraper made of poured cement and filled
    with long broken clockwork technology. Surrounding the skyscraper itself is a veritable sea of junkfloats connected by hinges and bridges,
    with large docks allowing a horde of ships of all sizes to be docked, and even repaired, at one time.
</p>
<p>
    The junkfloats serve as the outer shell of the city, providing markets, warehouses, temporary housing, farming, and more, mainly to support
    visitors and those who live off of them. The interior of the skyscraper houses the permanent residents of Wavescraper, with the poorest living
    under the water, fearing every day that their home will flood, while the rich live at the top and expand their penthouse suites with
    expansions made from material imported from the coast.
</p>
<p>
    The original economy of Wavescraper was based around scavenging the remains of the clockwork technology within the skyscraper, but as it
    grew and the workable clockwork metals had been pulled from the skyscraper, Wavescraper transitioned into the trade hub of Oceanside.
    Now many a good can be found in the markets of Wavescraper, from drinking water and food to slaves and deep sea spices, with the slave
    markets having become the center of the flesh trades in the Oceanside.

<h2 id="organizations-and-monsters">Organizations and Monsters</h2>
<h3 id="tenguud">The Tenguud</h3>
<p>
    A group of sorcerers and clerics of the <ap-link-button linkName="zigies">Clockwork God</ap-link-button> who serve as the legal authority of Wavescraper,
    the Tenguud prize the depths of the skyscraper and seek any ancient clockwork prizes they can acquire. Callous to a fault and interested in the rest of the
    populace of Wavescraper only as far as it benefits them, particularly taxes and hard labor.
</p>
<p>
    Few people work directly with the Tenguud, who like to deploy "barely restrained hounds" loyal only to the Tenguud that sent them. To the average resident
    of Wavescraper, the Tenguud appear as if they are a united, malevolent force, but in reality they are at constant, brutal war with each other while
    desperately trying to find any way to attack their rivals within the rules layed out by Tenguud's Council of Control.

<h2 id="notable-locations">Notable Locations</h2>
<h3 id="boolzeel">Boolzeel Slave Market</h3>
<p>
    Comparable in size to a whole bazaar, the Boolzeel Slave Market is the beating heart of Wavescraper's slave trade. Owned and operated by
    <a href="#darya-taheri">Slavemaster Darya Taheri</a>, who ensures that all other slave markets in Wavescraper are anemic in comparison.
</p>
<p>
    The main plaza of the Boolzeel Slave Market is open with four main stages able to hold 12 slaves shoulder to shoulder or 4 slaves in
    standard cages with a transfer booth next to each stage and the office of <a href="#darya-taheri">Slavemaster Darya</a> herself just off the plaza. Several
    paid thugs stand about the plaza, ensuring that all transfers go through <a href="#darya-taheri">Darya's</a> people. Directly beyond the plaza is a circle
    of rentable stalls that normally have food and drink, as well as common tools for slavers and other random goods. Further out beyond that are shops, inns
    and bars that service those visiting the slave market.
