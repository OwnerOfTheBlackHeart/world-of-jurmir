<p>
    Jutting out of the ocean, Wavescraper is a city built in and around the remains of a sunken skyscraper made of poured cement and filled
    with long broken clockwork technology. Surrounding the skyscraper itself is a veritable sea of junkfloats connected by hinges and bridges,
    with large docks allowing a horde of ships of all sizes to be docked, and even repaired, at one time.
</p>
<p>
    The junkfloats serve as the outer shell of the city, providing markets, warehouses, temporary housing, farming, and more, mainly to support
    visitors and those who live off of them. The interior of the skyscraper houses the permanent residents of Wavescraper, with the poorest living
    under the water, fearing every day that their home will flood, while the rich live at the top and expand their penthouse suites with
    expansions made from material imported from the coast.
</p>
<p>
    The original economy of Wavescraper was based around scavenging the remains of the clockwork technology within the skyscraper, but as it
    grew and the workable clockwork metals had been pulled from the skyscraper, Wavescraper transitioned into the trade hub of Oceanside.
    Now many a good can be found in the markets of Wavescraper, from drinking water and food to slaves and deep sea spices.
