<p>
    A large, ramshackle city made of hastily constructed buildings ranging from rough hewn log to plank to dried clay or adobe brick, and even rammed earth.
    Within the dirt-mound backed log outer walls of the city is a maze of winding, narrow streets and scattered markets with
    the river running through the center of the city being the only semi-straight travel way. A number of drawbridges allow
    passage over the Lostbass River during the day when they have operators. The city entirely lacks churches or temples.
</p>
<p>
    Docks are present on either side of the city as well as a small boat dock within the city proper.
</p>
<p>
    There is no slave market or open slave trade in Iirie, however slaves are not a rarity within Iirie. Those familiar with
    Iirie, or who have hired a local dracoman to aid them (5gp per day), gain a +2 to checks to find a slave for purchase.
    Those extremely familiar with Iirie, or who have hired a veteran dracoman (25gp per day), gain a +4 bonus instead.

<h3 id="slayers-guild">The Slayer's Guild</h3>
<p>
    Instead of having an <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-adventurers-league">Adventurers' League</ap-link-button> office, the 
    adventurers of Iirie copied the model of the Slayers' Guild of <ap-link-button linkName="noble-taaira-ruzara">Taaira Ruzara</ap-link-button>
    with an additional anti-government bent. As a Slayers' Guild, they focus on monster hunting and dangerous beast culling over
    dungeon delving or exploration and looting, though they take quests for such missions all the same. Given how the Guild's founders and its
    members have faced systematic oppression and tyranny, the Slayers' Guild doesn't take donations of any kind from anyone that isn't a tenured
    member, with the majority of their wealth coming from quest payments and the guild bar.

<h2 id="important-people">Important People</h2>
<h3 id="zari-tajik">Sadar Zari Tajik</h3>
<p>
    A drop dead gorgeous human woman with tanned skin, black hair, deep chocolate eyes and C cup titties. Zari normally wears fine,
    red and purple silks tailored show off her curves, in multiple styles from a Lyrnan toga to the dresses of Taaira Ruzara to the
    hooded robes of the desert dwellers and the minimalistic attire of the swamp dwellers. Zari changes up her jewelry regularly, but
    it almost always silver without any gemstones, whether earrings, necklaces, chokers, etc.
</p>
<p>
    Zari is friendly and welcoming to outsiders, as well as to humans, but she is used to being in command and doesn't tend to take
    resistance well, though she favors subtly and manipulation over anger and violence when overcoming someone resisting her. Despite
    the strictness and control of her rule, her people still love her and view her as a powerful ruler.
</p>
<p>
    Zari has a bodyguard named Konid that is a goliath of a man standing at 6' 3" with a voice like an earthquake who has never been seen out of
    his armor, or far from his oversized greatsword. When not guarding Zari, Konid is out and about serving as the eyes, ears, mouth and fist
    of Zari. The people of Iirie respect Konid, but don't seem to fear him... unless they are criminals.

    runes branded on her back (which make no sense).
</p>
<p>
    When not in her armor, Luta likes to look pretty and will put on basic, homemade makeup. If she feels
    she can get away with it Luta will put on her yellow silk dress, with a flowery satin corset, expensive furs, and jeweled
    necklace and rings. When she she can't get away with her nice dress, Luta will put on her sturdy leather
    dress and boots. 
</p>
<p>
    As Emira, Luta serves both as <a href="#zari-tajik">Sadar Tajik's</a> general-in-chief, maintaining the standing army, militia and

    boots and splattering of silver and gold jewelry, most of which is for sale. When out and about, she adds a wide brimmed straw hat.
</p>
<p>
    Dakota is cheerful and friendly, enjoying the company of others and generally offering support when it is needed. While Dakota will often humor the
    flirting of male customers, she makes no secret of her preferring another woman's company.

    weaves into his hair or beard.
</p>
<p>
    Kar is a good humored and jolly fellow who likes the ladies as much as they like him. He is well aware of how much of an effect he has

<h3 id="tonna-thorvidottir">Tonna Thorvidottir</h3>
<p>

    freckled pale skin and C cup titties. When working, Tonna wears a revealing royal purple chiton with only one shoulder pined by a platinum
    broach with a large embedded ruby and a silver crown with 4 smaller rubies around a large, vibrant sapphire. When not working, Tonna wears
    light furs and allows her hair to hang wildly from her head, like the barbarian she pretends to not be while working.
</p>
<p>
    Tonna is happy to operate the baths at <a href="#scarlet-sauna">Scarlet Sauna</a> and more than ready to flirt with just about any customer
    that initiates. She is a popular bather, especially with magically inclined adventurers, for her beauty and skill as much as for her willingness 
    to rub herself up against any customer who's flirted with her or asked for her special treatment.
</p>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm undesten-full iirie-full tonna-thorvidottir-clothes-origin">
    <p>
        The dye for Tonna's chiton, as well as the jewelry that she wears with it, were bought from <a href="#zari-tajik">Sadar Tajik</a>
        for Tonna's youngest sister, Frida. According to Tonna, her sister is beautiful, but lazy, and does everything in her power to escape
        responsibility to read books, run or play sports, so sitting around the palace in barely any clothing is a dream job for Frida.
        When Tonna last talked to Frida, she was loving the job.
    </p>

        The price for purchasing the <a href="#scarlet-sauna">Scarlet Sauna</a> was Tonna promising <a href="#zari-tajik">Sadar Tajik</a> 
        her first born. Tonna has figured out a way around this, however, and has acquired a potion that will cause her to have at least

<p>
    Abaka is not the friendliest, but he also isn't mean, he's just the type to take your money and not ask many questions.
    He doesn't care <b>why</b> you are looking to rent a bed, just that you are renting a bed... or whatever business you

    Yeshana is 5' 9" tall catfolk-aberration dragon hybrid with matte black fur, ass-length black hair in a braided pony-tail with a tuft of 
    black hair covering from her shoulders to the tops of her D-cup breasts (which hides a second, large mouth), four arms, and golden-yellow 
    eyes with cat-like slit pupils.
</p>
<p>
    Yeshana typically wears her "princess dress," a small, silver dress with red accents that mostly covers her waist with deep cleavage that 
    goes to just above the knees with a split in the sides. For jewelry, Yeshana wears a silver choker with a ruby in the center, a silver signet ring, 
    2 silver bracelets, and a pair of silver rings with inset red spinel. When she goes to court, Yeshana wears a golden chain over her chest mouth.
    Yeshana keeps a chainshirt made from a silvery metal with a strange sheen to it in her office. When threatened Yeshana can summon the armor onto
    her as a non-provoking move action as long as she and the armor are on the same plane.
</p>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm undesten-full iirie-full yeshana-black-armor">
    <p>
        Yeshana's armor is made of Nerium. If asked about it, she will explain that a heroine catfolk named Nera known for removing the human breeding curse
        discovered the metal and the methods to forge it, and as such it is named Nerium. She can even explain that after removing the human breeding
        curse, she also killed a local god of monsters that created monster waves that plagued 
        <ap-link-button linkName="noble-taaira-ruzara">Taaira Ruzara</ap-link-button> roughly once a generation, before leaving to court the
        Empress. Another suitor, frustrated at Nera's success and trying to impress the Empress, performed a summoning ritual powerful enough to
        summon a greater god, only to summon <ap-link-button linkName="sithrak">Sithrak</ap-link-button> directly in the Empress's palace.
        For reasons unknown, <ap-link-button linkName="sithrak">Sithrak</ap-link-button> immediately smited Nera hard enough that not even dust remained.
        Yeshana isn't sure why <ap-link-button linkName="sithrak">Sithrak</ap-link-button> did that, but she suspects that Nera was part way through ascending
        to godhood and that pissed off the God of Hate. Either way, <ap-link-button linkName="sithrak">Sithrak's</ap-link-button> smiting of Nera pissed off
        <ap-link-button linkName="lindo">Lindo</ap-link-button>, the God of Death, Undead, Souls, Bards, History and Art, enough for

    The Palace of <a href="#zari-tajik">Sadar Zari Tajik</a> is a large building molded from dried clay with decorative wooden latices and
    blinds placed across the faces of the building, along with fabric awnings over most of the windows. The palace itself is painted in

    of legendary warriors including one that seems to be fighting fire, water, wind and earth all at once, gold and silver engravings, and
    plentiful patterned draperies.
