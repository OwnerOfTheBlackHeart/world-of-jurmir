<p>
    A large, ramshackle city made of hastily constructed buildings ranging from rough hewn log to plank to dried clay brick.
    Within the dirt-mound backed log outer walls of the city is a maze of winding, narrow streets and scattered markets with
    the river running through the center of the city being the only semi-straight travel way. A number of drawbridges allow
    passage over the Lostbass River during the day when they have operators. The city entirely lacks churches or temples.
</p>
<p>
    Docks are present on either side of the city as well as a small boat dock within the city proper.
</p>
<p>
    There is no slave market or open slave trade in Iirie, however slaves are not a rarity within Iirie. Those familiar with
    Iirie, or who have hired a local dracoman to aid them (5gp per day), gain a +2 to checks to find a slave for purchase.
    Those extremely familiar with Iirie, or who have hired a veteran dracoman (25gp per day), gain a +4 bonus instead.

<h2 id="important-people">Important People</h2>
<h3 id="zari-tajik">Sadar Zari Tajik</h3>
<p>
    A drop dead gorgeous human woman with tanned skin, black hair, deep chocolate eyes and C cup titties. Zari normally wears fine,
    red and purple silks tailored show off her curves, in multiple styles from a Lyrnan toga to the dresses of Taaira Ruzara to the
    hooded robes of the desert dwellers and the minimalistic attire of the swamp dwellers. Zari changes up her jewelry regularly, but
    it almost always silver without any gemstones, whether earrings, necklaces, chokers, etc.
</p>
<p>
    Zari is friendly and welcoming to outsiders, as well as to humans, but she is used to being in command and doesn't tend to take
    resistance well, though she favors subtly and manipulation over anger and violence when overcoming someone resisting her. Despite
    the strictness and control of her rule, her people still love her and view her as a powerful ruler.
</p>
<p>
    Zari has a bodyguard named Konid that is a goliath of a man standing at 6' 3" with a voice like an earthquake who has never been seen out of
    his armor, or far from his oversized greatsword. When not guarding Zari, Konid is out and about serving as the eyes, ears, mouth and fist
    of Zari. The people of Iirie respect Konid, but don't seem to fear him... unless they are criminals.

    runes branded on her back (which make no sense).
</p>
<p>
    When not in her armor, Luta likes to look pretty and will put on basic, homemade makeup. If she feels
    she can get away with it Luta will put on her yellow silk dress, with a flowery satin corset, expensive furs, and jeweled
    necklace and rings. When she she can't get away with her nice dress, Luta will put on her sturdy leather
    dress and boots. 
</p>
<p>
    As Emira, Luta serves both as <a href="#zari-tajik">Sadar Tajik's</a> general-in-chief, maintaining the standing army, militia and

</p>
<p>

    weaves into his hair or beard.
</p>

<p>
    Tonna is a 10 out of 10 female human with ass length strawberry blonde hair kept straight with a slight waviness to it, bright green eyes, 
    freckled pale skin and C cup titties. When working, Tonna wears a revealing royal purple chiton with only one shoulder pined by a platinum
    broach with a large embedded ruby and a silver crown with 4 smaller rubies around a large, vibrant sapphire. When not working, Tonna wears
    light furs and allows her hair to hang wildly from her head, like the barbarian she pretends to not be while working.
</p>
<p>
    Tonna is happy to operate the baths at <a href="#scarlet-sauna">Scarlet Sauna</a> and more than ready to flirt with just about any customer
    that initiates. She is a popular bather, especially with magically inclined adventurers, for her beauty and skill as much as for her willingness 
    to rub herself up against any customer who's flirted with her or asked for her special treatment.
</p>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm undesten-full iirie-full tonna-thorvidottir-clothes-origin">
    <p>
        The dye for Tonna's chiton, as well as the jewelry that she wears with it, were bought from <a href="#zari-tajik">Sadar Tajik</a>
        for Tonna's youngest sister, Frida. According to Tonna, her sister is beautiful, but lazy, and does everything in her power to escape
        responsibility to read books, run or play sports, so sitting around the palace in barely any clothing is a dream job for Frida.
        When Tonna last talked to Frida, she was loving the job.
    </p>
    <p>
        The price for purchasing the <a href="#scarlet-sauna">Scarlet Sauna</a> was Tonna promising <a href="#zari-tajik">Sadar Tajik</a> 
        her first born. Tonna has figured out a way around this, however, and has acquired a potion that will cause her to have at least
        twins, allowing Tonna to keep the second child and not have her first birth go to waste.

    from excess coins).
</p>
<p>
    Abaka is not the friendliest, but he also isn't mean, he's just the type to take your money and not ask many questions.
    He doesn't care <b>why</b> you are looking to rent a bed, just that you are renting a bed... or whatever business you
    have with him. If he knows that you use his establishment to commit crimes, Abaka raises the price for you, but
    says nothing about your activities. Both adventurers and fences prefer his inn.

    apron, along with large earings and a heavy bead neck guard.
</p>

    blinds placed across the faces of the building, along with fabric awnings over most of the windows. The palace itself is painted in
    vibrant yellows, reds and purples. The inside of the building is a maze of hallways and offices adorned with decorative columns, frescos
    of legendary warriors including one that seems to be fighting fire, water, wind and earth all at once, gold and silver engravings, and
    plentiful patterned draperies.
</p>
<p>
    While most of the Palace is hard to find or navigate, the court of <a href="#zari-tajik">Sadar Tajik</a> is set in the center of the
    palace in an open air courtyard that incorporates rope controlled fabric roofs that can be extended for shade or cover from the rain.

    Perinone Pawn. Random goods can be bought and sold here, though most of the stock is used clothes and weapons, with the occasional
    piece of restored armor being on display in the back of the showroom. For obvious reasons, Perinone Pawn is popular with adventurers
    looking to get a cheap replacement or sell off the goods of their latest kill.

</p>
<p>
    The Scarlet Sauna is the main base of the local bather's guild, but exists to sell bathing services. The Scarlet Sauna provides public baths,
