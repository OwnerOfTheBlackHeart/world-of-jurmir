    <p>
        This foyer is both simple and ornate at the same time. Made purely of ice with a huge bear hide nailed to the floor as a carpet,
        murals carved into the walls and ice sculptures of a headless woman, this room lacks even the most basic gem or precious metal.

    <h3 id="office">Office</h3>
    <p>
        A basic office where someone appears to have designed to greet guests in some official capacity. The room contains a desk made of ice,
        some kind of ink that doesn't freeze even in this cold, a few upholstered chairs and plenty of parchment. Several empty journals sit in
        the desk. A handful of flowers and fruiting bushes that grow on ice add some life to the room, as does the natural sunlight coming through
        the clear ice ceiling.

    <p>
        A room full of basic supplies, ranging from spare parchment and ink to extra ice tables, towels and bedsheets. The one thing that this room
        distinctly lacks is food.

    <h3 id="library">Library</h3>
    <p>
        A library filled with ice bookshelves, artifact stands and scroll holders. About half of the contents of the library are books and journals penned
        by someone named Namki, and detail a mix of studies of the various artifacts and scrolls in the library as well as experiments into the Plane of
        Water (DC 15 Knowledge (planes) shows that Namki has mistaken the plane of <ap-link-button linkName="frostgard">Frostgard</ap-link-button> for the 
        Plane of Water. DC 20 Knowledge (history) reveals that <ap-link-button linkName="frostgard">Frostgard</ap-link-button> once belonged to the Primordial
        of Water). 
        The focus of the artifacts and treatises is the Age of Primordials.

    <p>
        A relatively small room containing a sink, a toilet that dumps outside the workshop, a bath and several towels. Soap and hot rocks are held in a basic
        wooden set of shelves and allow the room to serve as a bath or a sauna.
    </p>

    <h3 id="bedroom">Bedroom</h3>
    <p>
        A bedroom that is the nicest room in the house. The bed is large, soft and covered in warm blankets with a basic ember heating bin and curtains.
        Not far from the bed is a standing, silver mirror and a fine wardrobe with a fine cloak, a pair of nice boots and long strips of silken bandages.
        In the back of the room is a clothes washing station and a drying station/heater. A beautiful, handwoven wool carpet covers the floor.
