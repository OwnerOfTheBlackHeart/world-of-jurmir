    <div>
        <p>
            Vibeke is a 9 out of 10 female hellhound with messy dark blue hair that drapes down to her knees, ruby eyes, lightly tanned skin and
            B cup breasts. Abnormally for her kin, Vibeke has blue fur on her hands and feet, up to the elbow and knee respectively. As she stands,
            Vibeke wears nothing save a collar, a pair of serpent themed manacles, and chains.
        </p>
        <p>
            Vibeke, or Sofie to those who have trouble with her first name, is a firebrand from the Heck's Hounds first wave into Undesten. Forced into
            the desertside by the hordes of monsters in the northern wastes, Vibeke was eventually captured and enslaved by sand raiders that ambushed her
            while she was eating. While she has managed to self-destruct her wargear, the hobgoblins have managed to keep her in 
            chains since they bought her from sand raiders.

        This building appears to be the home of someone important to the lab's operation. While simple in construction, it is rather spacious,
        especially given the city surrounding it.
    </p>

    <h3 id="living-room">Living Room</h3>
    <p>
        The main room of this house, a general living space with a dining table and a pair of couches facing each other with a coffee table between
        them. A normal hallway leading to the back yard and a storage area are also part of this room.
    </p>

    <h3 id="bedroom">Bedroom</h3>
    <p>
        Easily the fanciest room of the house, the bedroom is dominated by the silken sheeted, king sized bed. Aside from the bed, the furniture
        is finely made, but simple. At night, Maral sleeps here.

    <h3 id="yard">Yard</h3>
    <p>
        The fenced back yard of the house, clean cut grass and a flower garden offer a calming atmosphere despite the raging sun. A shaded sitting
        area with a desk sits a little off center while at the back of the yard stands a brick shit house that is enchanted to remain comfortably
        cool.

    <h2 id="rooms-building-2">Rooms, Building 2</h2>
    <p>

        indication.
    </p>

    <h3 id="stores">Stores</h3>
    <p>
        Having doors large enough for a wagon to be driven into the room on the outside and doors large enough inside for large equipment to
        be transported within the building, this room serves as the stores room for the lab, containing a variety of magical ingredients and
        spare equipment.

        only the magical aura the device gives off reveals it to be functional.

                        The Acceleration Camber was created by the semi-mad hobgoblin wizard Maral Ogogch and a cabal of lesser wizards,
                        using a powerful ritual to combine their magical potential just to cast the spell to create the Acceleration Chamber.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When a creature that is not yet an adult is placed within the Acceleration Chamber, they begin rapidly aging at a
                        rate of 3 months per day until they reach the minimum age to be an adult (example: a human would age to 16 years old).
                        For creatures with age categories, the Acceleration Chamber will only bring them to Young Adult. Creatures aged by the
                        Acceleration Chamber have all the hit dice and skills one would expect (except knowledge skills), with creatures that have only class levels for
                        hit dice having a single class level once they are finished aging. Creatures aged by the Acceleration Chamber cannot
                        gain Knowledge skills while within the Acceleration Chamber. The class provided by the Acceleration Chamber is normally
                        commoner. A creature within the Acceleration Chamber cannot leave the Acceleration Chamber until they are finished
                        aging to adulthood. A creature must spend 24 hour blocks within the Acceleration Chamber and consumes food and water
                        as normal, despite the accelerated aging.

                        One, or more, animamancers can operate the Acceleration Chamber. They must be able to cast the spell Speed Pregnancy
                        and spend 10 hours of their day solely on operating the Acceleration Chamber to be able to aid in accelerating the aging process. 
                        Add up the total caster level of all casters with Speed Pregnancy operating the Acceleration Chamber, to a max of 40.
                        If 5, or more, caster levels, the Acceleration Chamber ages the occupant(s) by 6 months per day. If 10, or more, caster
                        levels, the Acceleration Chamber ages the occupant(s) by 1 year per day. If 15, or more, caster levels, 2 years per day.
                        If 20, or more, caster levels, 3 years per day. If 25, or more, caster levels, 4 years per day. If 30, or more, caster
                        levels, 5 years per day. If 40, or more, caster levels, 10 years per day. Gestalt characters that can cast Speed Pregnancy
                        with both classes provide the sum of the caster level of both classes.

                        Wyverns have been found to be optimal vessels for hosting a divine soul. Physically powerful while not particularly mentally
                        resistant and carrying the latent magical potential that allows them to host powerful souls.

                        Maral was placed in charge of optimizing the Acceleration Chamber in case the artificial god was found capable of controlling
                        other wyverns.

                    <li>Orbei is headed to the Archive of the Clans to show off her creation and drop off a copy of "her" research</li>
                    <li>This facility was one of a series of Iryu Clan laboratories, but was the main facility supporting Orbei's plan</li>
                    <li>If Itizi is recruited, he is willing to carry gunslingers and mages, and has a rough idea of the path to the Archive of the Clans</li>

        This arcane lab is focused around a strange device large enough to place a horse into, but also contains a small office area and

    <h2 id="rooms-building-3">Rooms, Building 3</h2>
    <p>
        This building is a large, if basic, building that appears to be some sort of barracks.
    </p>

    <h3 id="rnr-room">R&R Room</h3>
    <p>
        This room is a basic room with a small kitchen worked by slaves and 3 long tables. When not used as a mess hall, this room serves
        what little rest the hobgoblins seem to need. Card games and fist fights are frequent occurrences.

    <p>
        This room is barely worthy of being called a barracks with piles of hay and blankets scattered about to provide the slaves with an
        approximation of a bed.

    <h3 id="barracks">Barracks</h3>
    <p>
        This room is a standard set of barracks for hobgoblins, with basic beds providing rest for weary warriors.
