<h1>Fallen Amid</h1>
<p>
    The remains of the village of Amid. The majority of the buildings were made of wood and paper, while the occasional cob
    or plastered brick building remains.
</p>
<p>
    The current residents of Fallen Amid are mephits, gricks and river drakes. Non-human cultists of the 
    <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button> poke around the ruins of Fallen Amid seeking a rumored
    way to turn themselves into humans, thus surviving the coming of the <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button>.

        the aberrations that seem drawn to the ruins.

        While the first 5 feet of wall are made of plastered brick, the rest of the wall and loft of this long barn are made of wooden
        poles with waterproofed paper draped tightly over them. The inside of the bar is clearly a stable, though all that is currently
        within the stalls are two young gricks, a handful of alien looking eggs, and several stalls that have been setup for...
        people to breed with the gricks?

    <h3 id="house-5">House 5</h3>
    <p>
        Made from plastered brick and painted in a garish, full house mural of an active river bed, this house stands apart from its neighbors.
        The inside of the house is dominated by a single pool of water replacing the normal dirt floor. The smell of the decaying corpses within
        spreads rapidly the moment the door is open. A pair of eyes stare up from the water before a rumbling of draconic comes from the water.
        The drake's name is Kussikarot and a fellow speaker of draconic may be able to engage her in parlay.

    <h3 id="house-6">House 6</h3>
    <p>
        This cob house's walls have not been replastered in some time and the door hangs off the hinges. The inside of the house is filled with
        decaying furniture and has a musk that calls to mind a deep feeling of loss.
    </p>

    <h3 id="house-7">House 7</h3>
    <p>
        While the frame of this wood and paper house is sturdy and the walls have been resealed recently, the slightly ajar door calls to frequent
        use, and the damage to the roof shows another project the current residents haven't gotten to.

        The cob walls of this house have been partially plastered and painted, and have clearly had fresh cob added recently, while the

        What looks to have once been a churches' farm or garden has devolved into little more than a marsh with puddles of muddy water just deep enough

        The Sanctuary of the plastered brick church, this room has been converted into something of a social area for the cultists that have moved into
        the church. The old shrine has been thrown out and has been replaced by a small kitchen and a dining room table.

        would be intolerable to the holy men that built the church. A staircase at the back of the storeroom leads into a basement.

    <h3 id="basement">Basement</h3>
    <p>
        In the basement rests a bathtub filled with a silvery fluid and coated in highly stylized carvings of people in common, but explicit, poses, 
        surrounded by statues of beautiful people in various states of dress. Behind the bathtub and deeper into the basement is a small shrine covered
        in art, a mix of lewd and wholesome, but all lovingly done. Fine carpets cover the floor and provide warmth for bare feet while several
        wrought iron coat racks and a bench provide places to store excess clothing.
    </p>
    <p>
        The bathtub is a Bath of <ap-link-button linkName="noble-ilvith">Ilvith</ap-link-button>, a magic item that promises to beautify those who submerge
        within the silvery waters. Submerging for at least 1 round causes the character to reroll their attractiveness score, tit size and dick size, as applicable,
        while spending at least 3 rounds submerged causes a character to also reroll their height and weight, and a character submerging for at least 1 minute
        causes the character to also reroll their sex. Characters affected by the Bath of <ap-link-button linkName="noble-ilvith">Ilvith</ap-link-button> must
        make a DC 15 Will Save, taking 1d6 Wisdom damage on a failed save. A character can only be affected by a Bath of 
        <ap-link-button linkName="noble-ilvith">Ilvith</ap-link-button> once per day.
    </p>
    <p>
        Characters with Use Magic Device can exert some level of control over a Bath of <ap-link-button linkName="noble-ilvith">Ilvith</ap-link-button>.
        On a DC 15 Use Magic Device check, the character can set the Bath of <ap-link-button linkName="noble-ilvith">Ilvith</ap-link-button> to only increase
        or only decrease the scores of its users for the rest of the day. On a DC 20 Use Magic Device check, the character can set the
        Bath of <ap-link-button linkName="noble-ilvith">Ilvith</ap-link-button> to have a specific sex that it will change characters that use it to and to set
        whether the characters use Heroic Dick Sizes. On a DC 25
        Use Magic Device check, the character can set the Bath of <ap-link-button linkName="noble-ilvith">Ilvith</ap-link-button> to use one of the following rolls
        in place of the normal 1d10: 1d4, 1d6, 2d4, 2d6, 1d6+4 or to increase the current attractiveness score by 1, up to 15. Characters controlling a
        Bath of <ap-link-button linkName="noble-ilvith">Ilvith</ap-link-button> can take 10 on their Use Magic Device checks to control the bath.
