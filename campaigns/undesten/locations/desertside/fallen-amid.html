<h1>Fallen Amid</h1>
<p>
    The remains of the village of Amid. The majority of the buildings were made of wood and paper, while the occasional cob
    or plastered brick building remains.
</p>
<p>
    The current residents of Fallen Amid are mephits, gricks and river drakes. Non-human cultists of the 
    <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button> poke around the ruins of Fallen Amid seeking a rumored
    way to turn themselves into humans, thus surviving the coming of the <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button>.

        Fallen Amid seeking a rumored way to turn themselves into humans, thus surviving the coming of the 
        <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button>. Such cultists also occasionally mate with, or bare the eggs of,
        the aberrations that seem drawn to the ruins.

        In the basement rests a bathtub filled with a silvery fluid and coated in highly stylized carvings of people in common, but explicit, poses, 
        surrounded by statues of beautiful people in various states of dress. Behind the bathtub and deeper into the basement is a small shrine covered
        in art, a mix of lewd and wholesome, but all lovingly done. Fine carpets cover the floor and provide warmth for bare feet while several
        wrought iron coat racks and a bench provide places to store excess clothing.
    </p>
    <p>
        The bathtub is a Bath of <ap-link-button linkName="noble-ilvith">Ilvith</ap-link-button>, a magic item that promises to beautify those who submerge
        within the silvery waters. Submerging for at least 1 round causes the character to reroll their attractiveness score, tit size and dick size, as applicable,
        while spending at least 3 rounds submerged causes a character to also reroll their height and weight, and a character submerging for at least 1 minute
        causes the character to also reroll their sex. Characters affected by the Bath of <ap-link-button linkName="noble-ilvith">Ilvith</ap-link-button> must
        make a DC 15 Will Save, taking 1d6 Wisdom damage on a failed save. A character can only be affected by a Bath of 
        <ap-link-button linkName="noble-ilvith">Ilvith</ap-link-button> once per day.
    </p>
    <p>
        Characters with Use Magic Device can exert some level of control over a Bath of <ap-link-button linkName="noble-ilvith">Ilvith</ap-link-button>.
        On a DC 15 Use Magic Device check, the character can set the Bath of <ap-link-button linkName="noble-ilvith">Ilvith</ap-link-button> to only increase
        or only decrease the scores of its users for the rest of the day. On a DC 20 Use Magic Device check, the character can set the
        Bath of <ap-link-button linkName="noble-ilvith">Ilvith</ap-link-button> to have a specific sex that it will change characters that use it to and to set
        whether the characters use Heroic Dick Sizes. On a DC 25
        Use Magic Device check, the character can set the Bath of <ap-link-button linkName="noble-ilvith">Ilvith</ap-link-button> to use one of the following rolls
        in place of the normal 1d10: 1d4, 1d6, 2d4, 2d6, 1d6+4 or to increase the current attractiveness score by 1, up to 15.
