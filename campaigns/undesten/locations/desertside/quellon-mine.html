<h1>Quellon Mine</h1>
<p>
    The Quellon Mine is a complex containing three smaller mines: An iron mine, a quartz mine and a quarry. The three mines share a single
    administrative center and a fortified workers' barracks, with a large contingent of hired guards that guard the mines themselves as well
    as regularly patrol the surrounding area to keep the gnoll population down.

<h3 id="admin-building">Admin Building</h3>
<p>
    The Admin Building is hardly impressive when compared to the <a href="#worker-barracks">Workers' Barracks</a>, being a five room, single floor
    wooden building with a stone foundation. The main room serves as the offices for the mines, with the guard captain's office and the holding cells
    attached directly. The two remaining rooms serve as flexible spaces that are used for whatever they are needed for when they are needed, usually
    storage.
</p>

<h3 id="worker-barracks">Worker Barracks</h3>
<p>
    A large, sturdy stone building with tower-like protrusions that offer firing ports, the workers' barracks is a keep on its own.
    The first floor of the building is the storage, while the second floor houses the workers themselves and the third is home to the kitchen.
    The inside of the barracks is mostly unadorned aside form the dining area that sees near constant use, serving also as the cards room
    and social area.
