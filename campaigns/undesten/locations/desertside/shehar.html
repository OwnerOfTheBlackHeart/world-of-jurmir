<p>
    Supporting the majority of Undesten with monster hunting and ruin raiding, the

    to support, organize and monitor adventurers within Undesten. Being that Shehar is the region's capital and that the 
    <a href="#shahs-palace">Shah's Palace</a>, and the court within, are in Shehar, the 
    <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-adventurers-league">Adventurers' League</ap-link-button> has setup their headquarters
    within the city.

    Mykale is an 8 out of 10 female aasimar with bright golden hair, shining gold eyes, flawless porcelain skin and D cup titties.
    Mykale normally wears robes that are as fine as they are humble, light and breezy, with a large golden broach with the symbol of the
    <a href="#adventurers-league">Adventurers' League</a> painted on it, marking her as the Overseer.
</p>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm undesten-full mykale-history">
    <p>
        Mykale is from Lyrna and took a ship to <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-iirie">Iirie</ap-link-button> to escape increasing
        extremism within the Church of <ap-link-button linkName="durn">Durn</ap-link-button>; However, after living in 
        <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-iirie">Iirie</ap-link-button> for 3 years, Mykale got tired of always hearing about how
        the lizardfolk or dwarves slighted people. She moved to Shehar and joined the 
        <a href="#adventurers-league">Adventurers' League</a>, eventually tiring of constantly risking her life. When an opening for
        a guild maiden opened up, Mykale took it and, almost 10 years later, her experience as a guild maiden and her rank as a member
        allowed Mykale to become the Overseer of the <a href="#adventurers-league">Adventurers' League</a> in Undesten.

    enough to cover her cooch, and a pair of barely maintained leather boots, without an ounce of jewelry. Given that almost no
    one sees Cotota when she isn't working or traveling between her home and work, it's unknown what she wears outside of her
    job.
</p>
<p>
    While Cotota genuinely cares for the animals left in her care, the same cannot be said for their masters, who Cotota mostly sees
    as surface dwellers she is forced to deal with because she is too ugly to function in drow society. A rare few have managed to
    break through her hard exterior, such as <a href="#azita-noori">Azita</a> and <a href="#lukas-cox">Lukas</a>, but they tend to
    respect her desire for privacy from everyone else. Cotota would rather perform her job naked rather than constantly ruin, and

<p>
    The Shah's Palace is a massive siheyuan style building with three plastered stone stories with five more stories made of wood,
    all painted with beautiful murals of naturalistic scenes, both of the desert and swamps. The inside of the palace is beautiful and
    opulent, filled with statues and artistically carved columns, large paintings, gilded walls and plentiful attractive servants.
    The outside of the palace is a large and deep garden with a gaudy marble fountain, countless carefully managed flowers and
    hedge mazes containing benches where visitors and aristocrats can sit and talk.
</p>
<p>
    The Shah's Palace is home to <a href="#asal-abdi">Shah Asal Abdi</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="bastards-bath">Bastard's Bath</h3>
<p>
    The Bastard's Bath is a large building made of plastered brick and painted in vibrant colors with a garish sign painted in pastels. The front
    doors lead immediately into an open room with a secretary's desk and couches, where bathers hang about waiting to be hired. The door to the
    left leads to the baths, made from carved stone with heating fires burning beneath, while the right door leads to a number of rooms rentable
    by the hour, each containing a nice bed, a sink with clean water in it and a chamberpot.
</p>
<p>
    The Bastard's Bath is both a bathhouse and a whorehouse, combined into one. They offer bathers/whores in all shapes and sizes.
</p>

<h3 id="market-of-heroes">Market of Heroes</h3>
<p>
    A small market with a silver engraved sign, the market of heroes is made up of a single well adorned stage with well made, and painted,
    steel cage. The guards of the Market of Heroes are clearly well payed mercenaries and the single notary is equally well adorned.
    What few people hang around the Market of Heroes are adventuring types and wealthy slavemasters.
</p>
<p>
    The Market of Heroes only sells player classed characters, sold as pre-trained adventures and sold to adventurer guilds and parties
    looking for an easy replacement or to supplement a lack of interest in their group. 
</p>

<h3 id="market-of-flesh">Market of Flesh</h3>
<p>
    Based around a meat market where fish, crocodile and various other animal meats are sold, the real value to outsiders and merchants
    is the fact that the Market of Flesh also sells normal slaves. While lacking the raised stands that one would see in a dedicated
    slave market, slavemasters and fishermen alike are welcome to rent out the stalls of the market to sell their flesh to passers by.
</p>

<h3 id="megaplex">The MEGAplex</h3>
<p>
    The MEGAplex is a massive structure made of massive sandstone bricks covered in facades from marble to bamboo that houses the
    headquarters of the <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-adventurers-league">Adventurers' League</ap-link-button> as well as a
    interior market provides nearly everything an adventurer could conceivably need, a food court with a surprising variety
    of options and rentable living quarters.
</p>
<p>
    The headquarters of the <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-adventurers-league">Adventurers' League</ap-link-button> takes up
    nearly a quarter of the MEGAplex with its many offices, library, training facilities and vault. Sections of the headquarters
    meant for dealings with clients use marble and gold facades with many well made murals, while those for guild members are
    covered in a comfortable, if plain, bamboo facade.
</p>
<p>
    The market is decorated in painted murals and silver inlays on top of plaster over the sandstone walls, and contains a multitude
    of shops open to both the public and <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-adventurers-league">Adventurers' League</ap-link-button>
    members. Some of the shops of note include a bank that offers 
    <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-adventurers-league">Adventurers' League</ap-link-button> members coin changing at rates of 5% (instead
    of the normal 10%), a smithy, a general goods store, a fletcher, a tailor, a stablemaster (for selling animals kept in the MEGAplex's
    stables), and more.
</p>
<p>
    The food court is relatively austere compared to the rest of the MEGAplex with the sandstone walls left bare and simple, comfortable
    tables laid around the food court. Human, elven, dwarven, catfolk and even ratfolk cuisine can all be found about the food court,
    with <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-adventurers-league">Adventurers' League</ap-link-button> members getting half off on fresh meals.
    A bar is also present, selling everything from dwarven whiskey to imported elven wines and meads from 
    <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-iirie">Iirie</ap-link-button>, but it offers no discounts.
</p>
<p>
    The inn included in the MEGAplex is available to the public, though 
    <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-adventurers-league">Adventurers' League</ap-link-button> members have priority for rooms and
    get half off their stays. The inn has individual rooms (good) and several suites of varying sizes and configurations available,
    and a small number of whores that offer their services to lonely adventurers and merchants.
