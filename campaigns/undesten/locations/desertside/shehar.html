<h2 id="notable-locations">Notable Locations</h2>
<h3 id="shahs-palace">Shah's Palace</h3>
<p>
    The Shah's Palace is a massive siheyuan style building with three plastered stone stories with five more stories made of wood,
    all painted with beautiful murals of naturalistic scenes, both of the desert and swamps. The inside of the palace is beautiful and
    opulent, filled with statues and artistically carved columns, large paintings, gilded walls and plentiful attractive servants.
    The outside of the palace is a large and deep garden with a gaudy marble fountain, countless carefully managed flowers and
    hedge mazes containing benches where visitors and aristocrats can sit and talk.
</p>
<p>
    The Shah's Palace is home to <a href="#asal-abdi">Shah Asal Abdi</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="bastards-bath">Bastard's Bath</h3>
<p>
    The Bastard's Bath is a large building made of plastered brick and painted in vibrant colors with a garish sign painted in pastels. The front
    doors lead immediately into an open room with a secretary's desk and couches, where bathers hang about waiting to be hired. The door to the
    left leads to the baths, made from carved stone with heating fires burning beneath, while the right door leads to a number of rooms rentable
    by the hour, each containing a nice bed, a sink with clean water in it and a chamberpot.
</p>
<p>
    The Bastard's Bath is both a bathhouse and a whorehouse, combined into one. They offer bathers/whores in all shapes and sizes.
</p>

<h3 id="market-of-heroes">Market of Heroes</h3>
<p>
    A small market with a silver engraved sign, the market of heroes is made up of a single well adorned stage with well made, and painted,
    steel cage. The guards of the Market of Heroes are clearly well payed mercenaries and the single notary is equally well adorned.
    What few people hang around the Market of Heroes are adventuring types and wealthy slavemasters.
</p>
<p>
    The Market of Heroes only sells player classed characters, sold as pre-trained adventures and sold to adventurer guilds and parties
    looking for an easy replacement or to supplement a lack of interest in their group. 
</p>

<h3 id="market-of-flesh">Market of Flesh</h3>
<p>
    Based around a meat market where fish, crocodile and various other animal meats are sold, the real value to outsiders and merchants
    is the fact that the Market of Flesh also sells normal slaves. While lacking the raised stands that one would see in a dedicated
    slave market, slavemasters and fishermen alike are welcome to rent out the stalls of the market to sell their flesh to passers by.
