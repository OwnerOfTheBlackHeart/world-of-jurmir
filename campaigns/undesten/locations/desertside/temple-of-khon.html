<h1>Temple of Khon</h1>
<p>
    Temple to a local minor god of local megafauna that was attacked by gnolls. The minor god was killed and his worshipers eaten.
</p>
<p>
    The temple is a stepped pyramid surrounded by the ruins of houses and outbuildings made of rammed earth.
</p>
<p>
    The current inhabitants of the Temple of Khon are a group of hobgoblins trying to breed elven and catfolk
    tieflings in order to create a new vessel and revive the minor god Khon, under their control as a god of
    war.
</p>

<h1 id="khon">Khon</h1>
<p>
    Khon, whose body is that of a huge humanoid deinotherium, an ancient elephant-like creature
            with downward facing tusks and a short, thick trunk, that also carries a pair of demonic wings. The reborn Khon, using the distraction and
            damage the party has caused, has killed off the hobgoblins in this room.

        Unlike the other houses, this one was built of sun dried and plastered bricks, though

        The main room of the temple, the shrine at the far end of the room has been left in

        and unpleasant inks, and the smell of sulfur hangs over this room. Eight pews are
        arranged into 4 rows, replaced by the hobgoblins for reasons most likely tactical.

        and past. The maps show that the catfolk were taken from raided catfolk tribes while
        the elves were brought in from some foreign hobgoblin empire, while the letters suggest
        that the hobgoblins were taking orders from a tribe out in the desert.

        This room has been converted to a mess hall, with tables and chairs scattered about,
        with a catfolk chained to a fireplace, with only enough chain to reach more wood and
        the scattered kitchen supplies.

        This room has been turned into a luxurious bedroom for the half-demon hobgoblin. It is
        hard to tell if he has been given fine accommodations because he is the leader or because
        he is someone of great import to the current operation.
