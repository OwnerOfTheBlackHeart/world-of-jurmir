<h1>Temple of Khon</h1>
<p>
    Temple to a local minor god that was attacked by gnolls. The minor god was killed and his worshipers eaten.

<p>
    The current inhabitants of the Temple of Khon are a group of hobgoblins trying to breed elven and catfolk
    tieflings in order to create a new vessel and revive the minor god Khon, under their control as a god of
    war.
