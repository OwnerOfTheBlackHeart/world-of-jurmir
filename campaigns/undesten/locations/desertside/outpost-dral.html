<h1>Outpost Dral</h1>
<p>
    Built from wood and standstone, this outpost is well built for its size and made in the <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-ming">Ming</ap-link-button>
    style hollow fort. A large, reinforced door is present on the north of the outpost while the southern side has a personnel door. Four towers 
    provide the fort the ability to quickly spot and react to incoming enemies.
</p>
<p>
    While the outpost is unlikely to survive siege weapons, it is more than sturdy enough to handle the normal threats expected within the deep deserts.
</p>

<h1 id="khojin">Khojin</h1>
<p>
    Khojin is a female human with brown skin, long deep brown hair that is left to flow behind her back, brown eyes, and C cup titties.
    She normally works naked at the front desk of the Dral Rest Stop, though when she has to go outside she will wear a set of loose,
    white robes that offer protection from the sun's wrathful rays. Like most deep desert people, she places little value in jewelry.
