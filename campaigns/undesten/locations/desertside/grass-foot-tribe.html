<p>
    Standing as a massive contradiction to the goodly races' perceptions of gnolls, the Grass Foot tribe's "camp" has been setup in the
    ruins of an old catfolk city. The sturdy, old stone foundations and homes carved into trees have been taken over by gnolls who have
    started building their own buildings among them, including crude mud huts, stacked stone houses, plank wood homes and even semi-permanent
    tents. The massive buildup of gnolls has lead to a boom city the size of any thriving metropolis, made up not only of gnolls looking
    to trade their raid loot, but also evil races such as the drow and hobgoblins, who find it difficult to trade with the goodly races, and
    even some catfolk tribes.
</p>
<p>
    The Grass Foot tribe marks themselves by painting their feet green with a grass based dye.

<h2 id="organizations-and-monsters">Organizations and Monsters</h2>
<h3 id="albnk">The Albnk</h3>
<p>
    The Albnk are a group of catfolk bankers that embedded themselves into the Grass Foot tribe's city early on and serve as loansharks and
    coinchangers within the city. They are particularly brutal in stamping out any competition, though their true motivation at the end of
    the day is to get their money, and they are willing to go to any lengths to do so.
</p>
<p>
    Most of the Albnk's power comes from the fact that nearly every business owes them something, and the chance to get a chunk of debt
    excused for a simple task is usually quite convincing to the debtors. When the Albnk need to exert force, they can rely on a number
    of thugs and mercenaries all too happy to take the money ask no questions beyond what needs done.
