<h1>Elder Tower</h1>
<p>
    A thick based tower ruin in the marble style of the oceanside ruins, save for the fact that any clockwork devices
    seem to have been looted long ago. Now the tower has fallen into ruin, with only two floors remaining, occupied by
    aberrations and undead.
</p>
<!-- An aberration dungeon with an aberration dragon as a capstone. Use black dragon as a base -->

        while others still have been stripped down to the bone and had their meat and offal sorted.

        This room is a series of stalls and a hand washing trough. While the stalls appear to be latrines

        Even so, someone, or something, has gone through the effort of keeping these rooms clean and roughly

    <p>
        Unlike the rest of the Elder Tower, the Planar Monitor looks to have gone entirely unlooted. The device itself
        is a large clockwork contraption with arcane runes carved all over it and a strange lectern with even stranger
        controls attached to it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The primary focus runeboard, a bronze plate with several runes, pipe holes and springs on it, is damaged and
        needs replaced. The alignment crystal is also currently attuned to the Plane of Air.
