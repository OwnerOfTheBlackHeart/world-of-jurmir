    Omid is a hungry wolf surrounded by sheep willing to sacrifice the cattle to survive another day. While he puts on a good face for merchants and
    travelers, he drains the money out of anyone who steps foot in his "rest stop". Every shop and brothel is owned by him in the end.

        Most likely cousins of Nikou Miri, they come from the same house and city as she does. Sold by their father, a cunt boy, to
        <a href="#omid-fathi">Beg Omid Fathi</a> as slaves, Katayoun took advantage of <a href="#omid-fathi">Omid's</a> preferences
        for dick girls and half-drow to be put in charge of her own shop, even though she is forced to live with <a href="#omid-fathi">Omid</a>
        and service his sexual needs. She has no illusions that much will change if her <a href="#shahin-miri">sister</a> has her way and takes over,
        except that Katayoun will have a choice where she sticks her dick.
    </p>
    <p>
        While Katayoun has no sexual interest in catfolk or eating food prepared by catfolk, she rather enjoys getting a catfolk tongue bath,
        and recommends it to others.

    bar sits at the back of the building and a clay fireplace offers warmth and light at night. The chairs and tables aren't the most
    comfortable, but they are strong and sturdy. The crowd is a mix of locals, whores from <a href="#humble-honeys">Humble Honeys</a>
    and travelers stopping to wet their tongues.

    A waist high round stone fence marks off where the gardens of <a href="#omid-fathi">the Beg</a> end and the rest of Jarut begins.
    The front doors are large and imposing, leading into an equally imposing foyer that is equal parts defensible and artistic,
    with statues, paintings and patterned rugs adding spice to the boring browns of the building material. <a href="#omid-fathi">The Beg's</a>
    sitting room and office are equally extravagant, as well as equally well guarded.
</p>
<p>
    The Beg's Keep is the home of <a href="#omid-fathi">Beg Omid Fathi</a>.
