<h1>Coal Bin</h1>
<p>
    A slave shop located in the <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-grass-foot-tribe">Grass Foot Tribe</ap-link-button>.
</p>
<p>
    Made from imported, carved stone bricks with murals of the Underdark etched into the walls, the Coal Bin is as ominous of a building
    as it is intriguing. Entering in the mushroom wood door leads into a dark, and surprisingly cool, room filled with a handful of cages
    hold drow. A finely made wooden pedestal stands at the back of the room with a large book sitting on it, the slave registry.
