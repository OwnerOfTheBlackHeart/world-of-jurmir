<p>
    Zigvail is a small town of aberromancers built into the ruins of the long lost buildings of Zigvail. The central building is an ancient
    skyscraper in which the administrative facilities and church to the <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button>
    with smaller two to five story buildings surrounding the skyscraper in which most of the town live. Around the town is not a great wall,
    instead a series of magical devices that ward off uncommanded aberrations.
</p>
<p>
    The buildings are made of ancient concrete, glass, and steel with patches made from fitted bricks and carved, fitted concrete chunks.
    Unlike the cold gray buildings that make up most of the Deadlands, the buildings of Zigval are brightly painted and seemingly full of
    life.

<h3 id="pearl-saints">The Pearl Saints</h3>
<p>
    A group of powerful aberromancers, the Pearl Saints provide the people of Zigvail with both spiritual guidance and protection. Worshipping
    the <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button> and believing that it is their mandate to build up the 
    <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King's</ap-link-button> army in preparation for the return of the Primordials (which they believe the
    current gods incapable of holding). To do this, they use the people of Zigvail to serve as both aberration incubators and as soldiers, requiring
    all women born in Zigvail to give birth to two aberrations before they are considered adults and citizens, while men must serve in the military
    for at least two years for the same rights.
</p>
<p>
    The Pearl Saints maintain a strick law code and keep order like a military, though they are few in comparison to the citizens and
    the citizenry have a less strict culture which is far laxer concerning the law... save those in active service, who other citizens
    act properly around.

    The Tower of the Saints is a skyscraper with 17 stories of enclosed floors remaining and a 18th roof floor, along with a 6 story basement garage
    filled with Everburning Torches that is setup to stable horses and wagons of medium size or smaller. The outer walls of the Tower are painted
    crimson and pearl. The front door is a set of four double doors, all made of clear glass, with a statue of a different human warrior before each door.
    To the right of the front door is a cement pad with a large, tall overhang that provides a place for horses and wagons to be parked, as well as the entrance
    to the basement garage.
</p>
<p>
    The three floors of the Tower of the Saints are dedicated to the Church of <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Churnobog</ap-link-button>, save a small
    guard office on the first floor. The fourth floor holds the administrative offices, and the remaining 12 stories are used by the 
    <a href="#pearl-saints">Pearl Saints</a> for everything from housing and mess halls to ritual rooms and libraries.
</p>
<p>
    The first floor of the Church of <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Churnobog</ap-link-button> is a grand entrance flanked by statues of human warriors,
    priests and various aberrations, leading to a hallway with several classrooms and a small town guard office, with a stairway that leads to the main 
    sanctuary on the second and third floor. The sanctuary itself takes up two floors with a pair of statues of 
    <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Churnobog</ap-link-button> that look like they are holding up the rest of the building alongside colored glass murals
    of the War Against the Gods. The opposite end of the sanctuary from the entry stairs is the altar, chancel, and pulpit, raised high so the people sitting
    in the pews filling the nave can hear the speaker. The ceiling is arched and painted with a mural depicting the <a href="#pearl-saints">Pearl Saints</a>
    saving the people of Zigvail from a horde of monsters.

    that holds the administrative offices below the balcony. The 4th floor serves as a hospital for <a href="#ruin-raiders">Raiders</a> injured
    in the line of duty while the 5th floor holds rooms that are rented out to <a href="#ruin-raiders">Raiders</a> who need them. The "roof"

<p>
    The Terraces are a series of smaller ruins of skyscrapers that have had their exposed sections built into clusters of flat structures
    covered in dirt, water, and crops that resemble terrace farms. Due to the hostile environment of the Deadlands, the Terraces are constantly
    worked by a large number of people. The floors below the individual terraces are used for storage.
</p>
<p>
    Most of the buildings that make up the Terraces are painted green and blue, though a few are painted red or yellow.
</p>

<h3 id="springs-and-gears">Springs and Gears</h3>
<p>
    Springs and Gears is a 4 story building with a clear smithy on the roof and a sign depicting a gear made from bronze hanging over the front door.

    changing as new ones are made and old ones are melted down into scrap.
</p>
<p>
    The first floor of Springs and Gears is the administrative floor with the front desk and offices, while the remaining 3 floors are dedicated to
    working with bronze, alchemical scrap and clockwork scrap. The roof has 6 different smelters and smithies, each designed for and kept at different
    temperatures to work with different metals.
</p>
<p>
    Bronze equipment can be purchased from Springs and Gears. Certain clockwork devices can be commissioned at Springs and Gears, but the commissioner
    is required to bring enough clockwork scrap for the piece to be made.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="#borte">Borte</a> currently serves as the master smith of Springs and Gears.
</p>

<h3 id="kittens-cradle">Kitten's Cradle</h3>
<p>
    The Kitten's Cradle is a 3 story building that is not a skyscraper, but a new construction made from fitted bricks with the four corners being made
    from carved chunks of concrete, all painted to look like the sky during sunset. The first floor is the entrance, kitchen and a few of the cheaper
    rooms. The second floor holds the majority of the rooms and even includes a shared shower and bath room with running, sun-heated water. The third
    floor is split into two suites that can each hold up to 10 people and include private baths and running, sun-heated water. The roof is setup as a
    sitting area for guests to use.
</p>
<p>
    About half of the rooms on the second floor are apartments.

    The Kitten's Cradle is owned and operated by <a href="#kannan-zarqan">Kannan</a>.
