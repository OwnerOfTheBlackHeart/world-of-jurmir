    skyscraper in which the administrative facilities and church to the <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button>

    instead a series of magical devices that ward off uncommanded aberrations.
</p>
<p>
    The buildings are made of ancient concrete, glass, and steel with patches made from fitted bricks and carved, fitted concrete chunks.

    life.

<p>
    A group of powerful aberromancers, the Pearl Saints provide the people of Zigvail with both spiritual guidance and protection. Worshipping
    the <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button> and believing that it is their mandate to build up the 
    <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King's</ap-link-button> army in preparation for the return of the Primordials (which they believe the
    current gods incapable of holding). To do this, they use the people of Zigvail to serve as both aberration incubators and as soldiers, requiring
    all women born in Zigvail to give birth to two aberrations before they are considered adults and citizens, while men must serve in the military
    for at least two years for the same rights.
</p>
<p>
    The Pearl Saints maintain a strick law code and keep order like a military, though they are few in comparison to the citizens and
    the citizenry have a less strict culture which is far laxer concerning the law... save those in active service, who other citizens
    act properly around.
