<h1>Korvian Castle</h1>
<p>
    Korvain Castle is an ancient fortification made up of eight equidistant towers covered in wrecked ballistae and cannons,
    a large cement wall connecting them, and several hardened cement buildings filling out the bailey. Within the basements
    of the castle is where the old armory is located, filled with what little remains of the rifles and pistols from the
    time of Steel.

    Korvain Castle is still staffed by clockwork soldiers that repel any who approach. The clockwork units remaining are
    made up of Clockwork Soldiers, Clockwork Hounds, Clockwork Gunslingers, and Clockwork Mages. A single Clockwork Overseer
    retains the last semblance of command.
