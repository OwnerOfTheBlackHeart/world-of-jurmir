<h1>Skycruiser</h1>
<p>
    The Skycruiser is the crash of an ancient combat airship whose name is no longer able to be translated.
    Much of the old mithral structure has rusted away and time has done a number on the old weapons and engine
    of the skycruiser. The old skycruiser rests on her side, but enough remains to offer cover for anyone brave
    enough to use it as cover.
</p>
<p>
    The Skycruiser is currently inhabited by aberrations that use it as cover from the sun and as a place to
    stash their eggs and their kills.

    <li>A handful of batlings</li>

    <p>
        This large, open space contains the ruins and rubble of several buildings that were damaged or destroyed by the
        crashing of the skycruiser. Two buildings remain mildly intact on either side of the crash site while the
        skycruiser itself is on its side with the keel having torn off and offered an entrance to the craft. Behind the
        wreck of the skycruiser remains the bronze skeleton of the balloon that once held the skycruiser aloft.

        This building is the remaining two stories of what was once a much taller building. The face of the building is
        concrete with a mostly attached brass door and windows long shattered. The inside of the building has become some
        kind of stony nest with a small pile of loot. The stairs at the back of the room have been smashed.

        Xithlin'da, the inhabitant of the building has been greedily eying Volcanth'tali's nest as an excellent expansion
        of his territory and is willing to offer his horde in exchange for the death of Volcanth'tali. Xithlin'da plans to
        use a number of scrolls of Wall of Stone they have to connect the two buildings and begin forging a proper dungeon.

        Volcanth'tali, the inhabitant of the building believes that Xithlin'da holds dark knowledge that Volcanth'tali wants.
        She is willing to offer her horde in exchange for the death of Xithlin'da, after which she will make her way over to
        his nest to search through his writings and books.
