<h1>Skycruiser</h1>
<p>
    The Skycruiser is the crash of an ancient combat airship whose name is no longer able to be translated.
    Much of the old mithral structure has rusted away and time has done a number on the old weapons and engine
    of the skycruiser. The old skycruiser rests on her side, but enough remains to offer cover for anyone brave
    enough to use it as cover.
</p>
<p>
    The Skycruiser is currently inhabited by aberrations that use it as cover from the sun and as a place to
    stash their eggs and their kills.
