<h1>Da Fuck?</h1>
<p>
    Da Fuck? is an old military base from the Age of the Old Gods. The base is made up of a large barracks building,
    a series of hangars, and a cement runway. On the runway are a pair of destroyed bronze bombers with their engines
    now nothing more than scrap and their propellers nothing more than bent metal. In the hangars are smaller, bronze
    biplanes in similar condition. The insides of the planes are covered in mithral rust.

    For unknown reasons, <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-batling">battlings</ap-link-button> like to sleep in the
    hangars at Da Fuck? and are hostile when awoken. If one approaches during the night, they can possibly speak with
    the batlings and may reveal that they seek to nest in the towers of
