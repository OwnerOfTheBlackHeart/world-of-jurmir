<h1>Scronfarf</h1>
<p>
    Scronfarf is a collection of shorter skyscrapers which struggled to reach 10 floors when they
    were built. The tight clustering and intermingling of storefronts suggest Scronfarf originally
    served as living space. Strange rods stretch from Scronfarf into the rest of the Deadlands,
    the purpose of which is unknown.
