<h1>Facility 28</h1>
<p>
    Looking like a large, flat concrete pad from the surface, Facility 28 is a collection
    of underground facilities connected by now collapsed tunnels. Remnants of unknowable
    machines litter the facilities, suggesting the facilities were for either research or
    manufacturing.

        as an impromptu incinerator for getting rid of failed experiments.
