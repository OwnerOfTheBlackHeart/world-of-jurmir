<h1>Facility 28</h1>
<p>
    Looking like a large, flat concrete pad from the surface, Facility 28 is a collection
    of underground facilities connected by now collapsed tunnels. Remnants of unknowable
    machines litter the facilities, suggesting the facilities were for either research or
    manufacturing.
