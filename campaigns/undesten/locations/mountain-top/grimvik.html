    Built into the face of one of the many mountains among the Mountainside, Grimvik connects just far enough onto the surface to be able to service the
    Lostbass River. Most of the buildings of Grimvik are either carved from stone are built from stone bricks carved from waste stone from the mines and
    carved buildings. While the laws of Grimvik are strict to most visitors, they are quite liberal by the standards of the dwarves.
