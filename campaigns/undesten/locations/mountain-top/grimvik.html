    Built into the face of one of the many mountains among the Mountainside, Grimvik connects just far enough onto the surface to be able to service the
    Lostbass River. Most of the buildings of Grimvik are either carved from stone are built from stone bricks carved from waste stone from the mines and
    carved buildings. While the laws of Grimvik are strict to most visitors, they are quite liberal by the standards of the dwarves.

<h2 id="organizations-and-monsters">Organizations and Monsters</h2>
<h3 id="the-party">The Party for the Fair Distribution of Space</h3>
<p>
    The Party for the Fair Distribution of Space, or simply The Party, is a political party in Grimvik that claims its platform to be one of fair distribution
    of land and living space; However, The Party frequently shows favoritism to aristocrats and Party members with seniority. While Grimvik's constitution
    technically allows for other parties to come to power, the fact that only the aristocracy can vote on the ruling party and that The Party has nearly every
    aristocrat supporting it, other parties have an uphill battle to achieve even a mild chance at taking power. The Party further uses the fact that
    all land and buildings within Grimvik are owned by the city to aggressively discourage the formation and joining of other political parties in Grimvik
</p>
<p>
    All positions of leadership within the Party are only available to the nobility. The highest position within the Party is Coordinator, a role which is in
    charge of coordinating the Party and determining the high level distribution of property, and is only available to those who have provided Grimvik and
    the Party with a great service.
</p>
<p>
    The current Coordinator is <a href="#anna-kardan">Coordinator Anna Kardan</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="important-people">Important People</h2>
<h3 id="anna-kardan">Coordinator Anna Kardan</h3>
<p>
    Anna is a 7 out of 10 female cheetahfolk with short golden hair, matching fur with black spots, orange eyes, a lithe body and E (DD) cup titties. She normally wears
    a large brimmed, pointy blue hat, a stylish coat with silver threads and gems woven in the dwarven style, a pair of fine, leather boots and plentiful
    jewelry along her neck, hands and ears, with her fur left to preserve her modesty. When eating, Anna will wear a pair of silk gloves to keep her fur
    out of her food.
</p>
<p>
    As expected of a catfolk, Anna is playful in her interactions with others, though she has managed to gain control over her natural flightiness. She is able to
    control herself well and manipulate people in ways they may not always expect.
</p>
<p>
    Anna is the acting Coordinator of <a href="#the-party">The Party for the Fair Distribution of Space</a>.
</p>

<ap-auth-container permissions="gm undesten-full anna-kardan-history">
    <p>
        Anna was originally brought into Grimvik as an indentured servant to a Lord Amin Najafi, who she uncovered was planning to develop a means to 
        control the nobility and take power within Grimvik. Anna revealed the plot to  <a href="#the-party">the Party</a> and provided <a href="#the-party">Party</a> 
        enforcers with the means to infiltrate Lord Amin's estate and arrest him. This act was deemed a sufficient deed to make her eligible for
        Coordinatorship.
    </p>
    <p>
        Anna, having spent time around the dwarves, realized how slow and predictable their politics were and utilized her knowledge of their politics to
        rapidly rise in societal rank, managing to grab the Coordinatorship within 4 years of gaining her freedom from Lord Najafi. Now she carefully plays
        the dwarven nobility to stay in power, dancing about their rules and traditions in a way only catfolk, and maybe humans, could ever think to do.

    shirt and pants, painted in colorful geometric shapes that make her stand out in a crowd, along with several pieces of heavy silver jewelry.
</p>
<p>
    Cota is, as one would expect of a slavemistress, a harsh and straight to the point individual with little time for beating around the bush, however she
    is rather patient with customers who are having trouble deciding which slave to purchase.

<p>
    Duua is a 4 out of 10 male dwarf with a long, silver beard and spiked salt and pepper hair with dulling sapphire eyes. Duua normally wears finely woven
    wool clothes of the current male dwarven fashion, the current being a button up shirt with long, drooping sleeves worn half buttoned to expose the chest
    hair. Duua rarely wears jewelry, as he believes that it is counter productive to his work by distracting the customer from the clothes themselves.
</p>
<p>
    Duua is a friendly, if showy, type who takes great pride in his work and seeks to ensure that his every customer is truly happy with their purchase, save
    those who come in for a premade outfit. He views them as needing clothes quickly and always assumes that they will be back at a later date to get proper
    clothes made.

    Nongrot normally wears a coal black vest with a coal black skirt that goes from her belly button to the middle of her calfs.
</p>
<p>
    Nongrot puts on her best customer service face when dealing with potential customers, but is openly bitter about the smithing accident that rendered her arm
    practically useless for forge work. She doesn't hate working the desk, but Nongrot longs for hammering steel once more.
