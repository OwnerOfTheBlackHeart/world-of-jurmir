    Built into the face of one of the many mountains among the Mountainside, Grimvik connects just far enough onto the surface to be able to service the
    Lostbass River. Most of the buildings of Grimvik are either carved from stone are built from stone bricks carved from waste stone from the mines and
    carved buildings. While the laws of Grimvik are strict to most visitors, they are quite liberal by the standards of the dwarves.

<h2 id="organizations-and-monsters">Organizations and Monsters</h2>
<h3 id="the-party">The Party for the Fair Distribution of Space</h3>
<p>
    The Party for the Fair Distribution of Space, or simply The Party, is a political party in Grimvik that claims its platform to be one of fair distribution
    of land and living space; However, The Party frequently shows favoritism to aristocrats and Party members with seniority. While Grimvik's constitution
    technically allows for other parties to come to power, the fact that only the aristocracy can vote on the ruling party and that The Party has nearly every
    aristocrat supporting it, other parties have an uphill battle to achieve even a mild chance at taking power. The Party further uses the fact that
    all land and buildings within Grimvik are owned by the city to aggressively discourage the formation and joining of other political parties in Grimvik
</p>
<p>
    All positions of leadership within the Party are only available to the nobility. The highest position within the Party is Coordinator, a role which is in
    charge of coordinating the Party and determining the high level distribution of property, and is only available to those who have provided Grimvik and
    the Party with a great service.
</p>
<p>
    The current Coordinator is <a href="#anna-kardan">Coordinator Anna Kardan</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="important-people">Important People</h2>
<h3 id="anna-kardan">Coordinator Anna Kardan</h3>
<p>
    Anna is a 7 out of 10 female cheetahfolk with short golden hair, matching fur with black spots, orange eyes, a lithe body and E (DD) cup titties. She normally wears
    a large brimmed, pointy blue hat, a stylish coat with silver threads and gems woven in the dwarven style, a pair of fine, leather boots and plentiful
    jewelry along her neck, hands and ears, with her fur left to preserve her modesty. When eating, Anna will wear a pair of silk gloves to keep her fur
    out of her food.
</p>
<p>
    As expected of a catfolk, Anna is playful in her interactions with others, though she has managed to gain control over her natural flightiness. She is able to
    control herself well and manipulate people in ways they may not always expect.
</p>
<p>
    Anna is the acting Coordinator of <a href="#the-party">The Party for the Fair Distribution of Space</a>.

<ap-auth-container permissions="gm undesten-full anna-kardan-history">
    <p>
        Anna was originally brought into Grimvik as an indentured servant to a Lord Amin Najafi, who she uncovered was planning to develop a means to 
        control the nobility and take power within Grimvik. Anna revealed the plot to  <a href="#the-party">the Party</a> and provided <a href="#the-party">Party</a> 
        enforcers with the means to infiltrate Lord Amin's estate and arrest him. This act was deemed a sufficient deed to make her eligible for
        Coordinatorship.
    </p>
    <p>
        Anna, having spent time around the dwarves, realized how slow and predictable their politics were and utilized her knowledge of their politics to
        rapidly rise in societal rank, managing to grab the Coordinatorship within 4 years of gaining her freedom from Lord Najafi. Now she carefully plays
        the dwarven nobility to stay in power, dancing about their rules and traditions in a way only catfolk, and maybe humans, could ever think to do.

<p>
    Najafi Manor is a three story manor built in the space where Grimvik transitions from being underground to being on the surface, built of square cut stone
    bricks. The outer walls have a sandstone square lattice attached to them, allowing a number of vines to grow up the face of the building. Surrounding the
    manor is a wrought iron fence featuring a diamond lattice, a jagged top and an arched entrance gate, with rose bushes being grown along the fence. The front
    yard of the manor is an arboretum with chairs and benches made from fallen branches that have been woven together.
</p>
<p>
    The inside of the manor heavily features natural materials, with rugs made from slain beasts, wooden busts and fine paintings that smell of fruit among stone
    statues and displayed plate armor. The entrance leads into a foyer that connects to a ballroom, which then branches out to the kitchen, bar, sitting room,
    offices, servants quarters and the path upstairs. The second floor is dedicated to guests while the third floor holds <a href="#anna-kardan">Anna's</a>
    personal bedroom and several empty bedrooms that are notably nicer than the guest or servant rooms.
