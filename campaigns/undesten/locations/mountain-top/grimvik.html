    Built into the face of one of the many mountains among the Mountainside, Grimvik connects just far enough onto the surface to be able to service the
    Lostbass River. Most of the buildings of Grimvik are either carved from stone are built from stone bricks carved from waste stone from the mines and
    carved buildings. While the laws of Grimvik are strict to most visitors, they are quite liberal by the standards of the dwarves.

<h3 id="the-party">The Party for the Fair Distribution of Space</h3>
<p>
    The Party for the Fair Distribution of Space, or simply The Party, is a political party in Grimvik that claims its platform to be one of fair distribution
    of land and living space; However, The Party frequently shows favoritism to aristocrats and Party members with seniority. While Grimvik's constitution
    technically allows for other parties to come to power, the fact that only the aristocracy can vote on the ruling party and that The Party has nearly every
    aristocrat supporting it, other parties have an uphill battle to achieve even a mild chance at taking power. The Party further uses the fact that
    all land and buildings within Grimvik are owned by the city to aggressively discourage the formation and joining of other political parties in Grimvik
</p>
<p>
    All positions of leadership within the Party are only available to the nobility. The highest position within the Party is Coordinator, a role which is in
    charge of coordinating the Party and determining the high level distribution of property, and is only available to those who have provided Grimvik and
    the Party with a great service.
</p>
<p>
    The current Coordinator is <a href="#anna-kardan">Coordinator Anna Kardan</a>.

        Anna was originally brought into Grimvik as an indentured servant to a Lord Amin Najafi, who she uncovered was planning to develop a means to 
        control the nobility and take power within Grimvik. Anna revealed the plot to  <a href="#the-party">the Party</a> and provided <a href="#the-party">Party</a> 
        enforcers with the means to infiltrate Lord Amin's estate and arrest him. This act was deemed a sufficient deed to make her eligible for
        Coordinatorship.
