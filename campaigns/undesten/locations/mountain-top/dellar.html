    Built from the surrounding forests, Dellar is a sprawling wooden town built around massive farms and orchards. One of the major sources of
    food for the town of Grimvik, Dellar is a rapidly growing town and a center of druidic power. Dellar is one of the few locations where elves
    are more common.
