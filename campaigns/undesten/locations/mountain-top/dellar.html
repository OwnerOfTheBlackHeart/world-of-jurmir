    Built from the surrounding forests, Dellar is a sprawling wooden town built around massive farms and orchards. One of the major sources of
    food for the town of Grimvik, Dellar is a rapidly growing town and a center of druidic power. Dellar is one of the few locations where elves
    are more common. And even more oddly, all the local elves and half elves are women, though the number of visiting elves disguises this to
    most travelers.
</p>
<p>
    Dellar is broken into two sections, the ground underneath the trees where a majority of the population lives and the forest canopy, where
    the native elves prefer to reside. Many bridges and ladders offer access between the two spaces and are frequently packed with people traveling
    between the ground and the trees.
</p>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm undesten-dellar-full undesten-full undesten-dellar-slaves">
    <p>
        Dellar lacks a significant slave market, through selling slaves in Dellar is not too difficult as the farms are always looking for more
        workers. However, drow sold to the <a href="#mothers-of-the-trees">Mothers of the Trees</a> are sold for double their purchase price.
    </p>

<h2 id="organizations-and-monsters">Organizations and Monsters</h2>
<h3 id="mothers-of-the-trees">Mothers of the Trees</h3>
<p>
    Dedicated towards using their druidic teachings to guide the people of Dellar towards sustainable lives that alleviate their impact on the
    natural world. An oddity of the Mothers of the Trees is that they are purely women capable of bearing children.
</p>
<p>
    The Mothers of the Trees operate out of the <a href="#abar-darkht">Abar Darkht</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="important-people">Important People</h2>
<h3 id="vulsao-mel">Head Mother Vulsao Mel</h3>
<p>
    Vulsao is a 2 out of 10 female elf with light brown hair, emerald eyes, a slender frame and A cup titties. She normally wears a suit of robe-like
    leaf armor adorned with thorny flowers and megaraptor talons, with a crown of hippo tusks. Head Mother Mel is a calm woman who seems to have wisdom
    far beyond her years, and does her best to guide others towards their best paths.
</p>
<p>
    Vulsao is the current Head Mother of the <a href="#mothers-of-the-trees">Mothers of the Trees</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Head Mother Mel lives in the <a href="#abar-darkht">Abar Darkht</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="ivago-tol">Mother Ivago Tol</h3>
<p>
    Ivago is a 6 out of 10, young female elf with long, flowing, dark leaf green hair, matching eyes, a slender frame and C cup titties. She normally wears a sleeveless,
    crop-top vest and a knee length, loose skirt both made of woven grasses padded with soft leaves and further woven with colorful flowers. Ivago's hair is
    decorated with totems of dyed wood and bone that smell of fresh fruit, regardless of the time of year.
</p>
<p>
    Ivago serves as the most common go-between for the people of Dellar and the <a href="#mothers-of-the-trees">Mothers of the Trees</a>, holding court for the common
    folk, deciding what druids are sent on what tasks and what issues are important enough to be directed to <a href="#vulsao-mel">Head Mother Mel</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Mother Tol lives in the <a href="#abar-darkht">Abar Darkht</a> and holds court in <a href="#zehnon-hall">Zehnon Hall</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="notable-locations">Notable Locations</h2>
<h3 id="abar-darkht">Abar Darkht</h3>
<p>
    This massive, ohi'a lehua tree has been grown in such a way as to rise beyond the clouds, far larger than a tree of its species should, with a thick, floral
    canopy with branches so large that houses have been built into them. A series of rope bridges extend from the Abar Darkht through many of the surrounding
    trees in such a way as to provide a taxing method of accessing the tree. A quartet of "trained" dire leopards provide the elderly and impaired a means to
    be carried up the trunk of the tree.
</p>
<p>
    The lower levels of the Abar Darkht, which rest well below the clouds, house most of Dellar's elven population, while the upper canopy is dedicated to the
    <a href="#mothers-of-the-trees">Mothers of the Trees</a>. Within the upper canopy the <a href="#mothers-of-the-trees">Mothers</a> have their homes, ritual
    sites, some of their shrines, and even the Hall of the Wood, where <a href="#vulsao-mel">Head Mother Mel</a> stays during the day to receive visitors.
    Aside from specific places of worship or meditation, the public is allowed into the upper canopy, but not permitted to take residence there.
</p>
<p>
    Abar Darkht serves as the home of the <a href="#mothers-of-the-trees">Mothers of the Trees</a> and their <a href="#vulsao-mel">Head Mother Mel</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="zehnon-hall">Zehnon Hall</h3>
<p>
    Second in importance only to the the Hall of the Wood for the <a href="#mothers-of-the-trees">Mothers of the Trees</a>, Zehnon Hall is their primary location
    of operation and the place where the rest of Dellar can meet with them in an official capacity. Looking like a wooden conch shell grown from one of the
    branches of the <a href="#abar-darkht">Abar Darkht</a> in the middle canopy, the majority of the structure is dominated by the colorful and lively courtroom
    where <a href="#ivago-tol">Mother Tol</a> holds court and serves as the day to day leader of the <a href="#mothers-of-the-trees">Mothers</a>.
    Eight offices provide space for meetings between those who have business with the <a href="#mothers-of-the-trees">Mothers</a>, and a basic kitchen and storage
    allow the courtroom to also be used as a feast hall during festivals and celebrations.
</p>
<p>
    Zehnon Hall hosts court for <a href="#ivago-tol">Mother Tol</a>.
</p>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm undesten-dellar-full undesten-full undesten-zehnon-hall-slave-pit">
    <p>
        Hidden in the back of Zehnon Hall, behind a door that only elves, including visiting male elves, seem to pass through is a small prison with 8 stockades.
        Within the cells and stockades are female drow in various stages of pregnancy and a handful of guards. Visiting male elves fuck the female drow, who are
        then forced to bear the children, which are then purified upon birth and reverted to normal elves and taken into the 
        <a href="#mothers-of-the-trees">Mothers of the Trees</a>. Any captured or purchased drow that are not female are turned into females via
        Animamancy.
