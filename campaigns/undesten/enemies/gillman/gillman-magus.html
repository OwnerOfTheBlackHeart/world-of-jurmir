<h2 id="enchantment-resistance">Enchantment Resistance (Ex)</h2>
<p>
    Gillmen gain a +2 racial saving throw bonus against non-aboleth enchantment spells and effects, but take a 
    –2 penalty on such saving throws against aboleth sources.
</p>

<h2 id="water-dependant">Water Dependent (Ex)</h2>
<p>
    A gillman’s body requires constant submersion in fresh or salt water. Gillmen who spend more than 1 day 
    without fully submerging themselves in water risk internal  organ failure, painful cracking of the skin, and 
    death within 4d6 hours.
</p>

<h2 id="spell-combat">Spell Combat (Ex)</h2>
<p>
    At 1st level, a magus learns to cast spells and wield his weapons at the same time. This functions much like two-weapon fighting, 
    but the off-hand weapon is a spell that is being cast. To use this ability, the magus must have one hand free 
    (even if the spell being cast does not have somatic components), while wielding a light or one-handed melee weapon in the 
    other hand. As a full-round action, he can make all of his attacks with his melee weapon at a –2 penalty and can also cast any 
    spell from the magus spell list with a casting time of 1 standard action (any attack roll made as part of this spell also takes 
    this penalty). If he casts this spell defensively, he can decide to take an additional penalty on his attack rolls, up to his 
    Intelligence bonus, and add the same amount as a circumstance bonus on his concentration check. If the check fails, the spell 
    is wasted, but the attacks still take the penalty. A magus can choose to cast the spell first or make the weapon attacks first, 
    but if he has more than one attack, he cannot cast the spell between weapon attacks.
</p>

<h2 id="spellstrike">Spellstrike (Su)</h2>
<p>
    At 2nd level, whenever a magus casts a spell with a range of “touch” from the magus spell list, he can deliver the spell through 
    any weapon he is wielding as part of a melee attack. Instead of the free melee touch attack normally allowed to deliver the spell, 
    a magus can make one free melee attack with his weapon (at his highest base attack bonus) as part of casting this spell. If successful, 
    this melee attack deals its normal damage as well as the effects of the spell. If the magus makes this attack in concert with spell combat, 
    this melee attack takes all the penalties accrued by spell combat melee attacks. This attack uses the weapon’s critical range (20, 19–20, 
    or 18–20 and modified by the keen weapon property or similar effects), but the spell effect only deals ×2 damage on a successful critical 
    hit, while the weapon damage uses its own critical modifier.
