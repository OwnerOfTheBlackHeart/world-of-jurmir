<h2 id="enchantment-resistance">Enchantment Resistance (Ex)</h2>
<p>
    Gillmen gain a +2 racial saving throw bonus against non-aboleth enchantment spells and effects, but take a 
    –2 penalty on such saving throws against aboleth sources.
</p>

<h2 id="water-dependant">Water Dependent (Ex)</h2>
<p>
    A gillman’s body requires constant submersion in fresh or salt water. Gillmen who spend more than 1 day 
    without fully submerging themselves in water risk internal  organ failure, painful cracking of the skin, and 
    death within 4d6 hours.
