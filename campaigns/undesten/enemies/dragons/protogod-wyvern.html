<h2 id="poison">Poison (Ex)</h2>
<p>
    <b>Sting</b>—injury; save DC 18; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d4 Constitution damage; cure 2 consecutive saves.
</p>
<p>
    The save DC is Constitution-based.
</p>

<h2 id="power-lift">Power Lift (Ex)</h2>
<p>
    A mythic wyvern can expend one use of mythic power to withdraw as a move action (instead of a full-round action), moving up to its 
    speed instead of double. It can even move straight up. If it’s grappling a creature, the wyvern can bring the grappled creature with it. 
    Usually a wyvern uses this ability to carry off its prey and drop it from above onto a hard surface. Since this is a move action, the 
    wyvern can damage its target, withdraw, and drop its target all in the same round.
