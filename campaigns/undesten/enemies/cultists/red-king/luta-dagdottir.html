    <i class="power">Weapon Alignment:</i>
    Luta’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the 
    purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Energy Drain (Su):</i>
    Luta drains energy from a mortal it lures into some act of passion, or by simply planting a kiss on the victim. 
    If the target is not willing to be kissed, the red ladies must start a grapple, which provokes an attack of opportunity. 
    The red lady’s kiss or embrace bestows one negative level. The kiss also has the effect of a suggestion spell, asking 
    the victim to accept another kiss from the red ladies. The victim must succeed on a DC 21 Will save to negate the effect 
    of the suggestion. The DC is 21 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. These save DCs are Charisma-based.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Spell-like abilities:</i>
    At will—charm monster (DC 22), detect good, detect thoughts (DC 20), ethereal jaunt (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), 
    suggestion (DC 21), greater teleport (self plus 50 pounds of objects only). Caster level 12th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Summon Demon (Sp):</i>
    Once per day luta can attempt to summon 1 vrock with a 30% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of 
    a 3rd-level spell.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Change Shape (Su):</i>
    Luta can assume the form of any Small or Medium humanoid.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Quickness (Su):</i>
    Luta is supernaturally quick. She can take an extra move action during its turn each round.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Tongues (Su):</i>
    Luta has a permanent tongues ability (as the spell, caster level 12th). Red ladies usually use verbal communication 
    with mortals.
</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Luta Dagdottir is a 10 out of 10, 6" tall Lyrnian woman with short, wavy brown hair, brown eyes and E (DD) cup titties. She has palish
    flesh with no visible scars, however she does have a dark scar underneath her left breast and dwarven
    runes branded on her back (which make no sense).
</p>
<p>
    Luta weighs 183 pounds, though she doesn't look it. She also has smooth, thin limbs that hide her great
    strength.
</p>
<ap-auth-container permissions="luta-rune luta-full aaron-full">
    <p>
        The rune on her back says "Property of Gurdath" in goblin.
    </p>
</ap-auth-container>
<p>
    When not in her armor, Luta likes to look pretty and will put on basic, homemade makeup. If she feels
    she can get away with it Luta will put on her yellow silk dress, with a flowery satin corset, expensive furs, and jeweled
    necklace and rings. When she she can't get away with her nice dress, Luta will put on her sturdy leather
    dress and boots. 
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
    When fighting alone, Luta will usually stick to either using her bow to outrange an opponent and kill
    them before they get close, or she will try to get within melee range and engage them with both of her
    weapons.
</p>
<p>
    When fighting with a group, Luta tries to coordinate manuevers to get her around the enemies so that
    she can lay into them with her two weapons, striking at their weakest points. She does try to avoid
    fighting more than two enemies at once.
</p>

<h2 id="history-and-motivation">History and Motivation</h2>
<p>
    Luta was born in the small settlement of Cuul, where she was raised by her parents. On her 13th birthday,
    amidst her family's celebration, a party of hobgoblins attacked and killed her father. Luta, her mother,
    and her two younger brothers were taken as slaves by the hobgoblins. She would escape 4 years later and
    begin traveling in the hopes that she could gain what she needed to get payback, eventually becoming a
    <ap-link-button linkName="red-lady">Red Lady</ap-link-button>, birthing a Chocker, and using the power from her transformation
    to kill the hobgoblins that captured her.
</p>
<p>
    After finding her family dead among the many victims of the hobgoblins, Luta traveled more, eventually
    finding <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-iirie" hash="zari-tajik">Zari Tajik</ap-link-button> and
    agreeing to join her congregation as her left hand. While Luta still has a good heart,
    <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-iirie" hash="zari-tajik">Zari's</ap-link-button> manipulations have
    made her follow <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-iirie" hash="zari-tajik">Zari</ap-link-button> almost
    blindly, only occasionally resisting in order to point out what she believes to be mistakes.
</p>

    <p>
        Luta was used for magical experiments by her old master, Gurdath. Gurdath is a hobgoblin wizard.
        He was trying to create warriors that would look unintimidating that could then use that to their
        advantage. This has no lasting magical auras on Luta.
    </p>
    <p>
        The experimentation has also left Luta more vulnerable to "training."
