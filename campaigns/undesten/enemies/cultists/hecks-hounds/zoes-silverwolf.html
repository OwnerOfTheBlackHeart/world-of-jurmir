<h2 id="pack-tactics">Pack Tactics (Ex)</h2>
<p>
    At the start of their turn, a Hellhound can designate a single enemy as their target. All allies with Pack Tactics, including the Hellhound herself, 
    gains a +1 moral bonus to attack and damage rolls against the target, up to +5 to attack and damage.
</p>

<h2 id="chaotic-perfection">Chaotic Perfection (Ex)</h2>
<p>
    Due to their inherently chaotic nature and acclimation to constant overstimulation, Silverwolves ignore the alignment restrictions of the Paladin and Monk classes.
