<h2 id="maddening-song">Maddening Song (Ps)</h2>
<p>
    A batling's chittering song has the power to infect the minds of those that hear it, causing madness in those who hear it.
    When a batling sings, all creatures aside from other batlings within a 90-foot spread must succeed on a DC 15 Will saving
    throw or suffer the effects of the Confusion spell. A creature that successfully saves is not subject to the same harpy's
    song for 24 hours. This affect continues for as long as the batling sings and for 1 round thereafter. This is a sonic
    mind-affecting charm effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.
</p>

<h2 id="destructive-cacophony">Destructive Cacophony (Ps)</h2>
<p>
    A batling can, as a Standard Action, either start or join a Destructive Cacophony. When starting a Destructive Cacophony,
    a batling selects a point within 30 feet to serve as the center of the Destructive Cacophony. To join a Destructive Cacophony,
    a batling must be within 30 feet of the center of the Destructive Cacophony. Each batling that joins the Destructive Cacophony
    adds 1d6 sonic damage to the Destructive Cacophony (maximum 10d6) and increases the DC by 1.
</p>
<p>
    At the end of the round the Destructive Cacophony was started, all creatures within 20 feet of the center of the Destructive
    Cacophony take 1d6 sonic damage per batling that joined the Destructive Cacophony. Succeeding on a Fortitude saving throw with a
    DC equal to 15 plus 1 per batling that joined the Destructive Cacophony halves the damage. Destructive Cacophony ignores spell 
    resistance and psychic resistance, and affects objects. The save DC is Charisma-based.
</p>

<h2 id="invisibility-to-aberrations">Invisibility to Aberrations (Ps)</h2>
<p>
    Aberrations are unable to detect batlings that do not directly interact with them.
</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Hanging between 3 feet tall and 3 foot 6 tall, batlings are small, bat-like humanoids known for gathering in large groups in
    dank, dark places. With large ears, even larger wings, taloned feet, and a brown, black or gray coat of fur. However, what batlings
    are truly known for are the fact that they are invisible to aberrations, common neighbors in their favored environments of dark
    caves, underground caverns and ruins, as well as their innate psionics.
</p>
<p>
    Batlings are proficient night hunters and scavengers, with a diet primarily consisting of large insects, small lizards and mammals,
    tree fruits, and the occasional large kill they can scare other predators away from using their Destructive Cacophony. They favor
    using their flight to stay out of range of anything that might threaten them, and rarely fight from the ground, though when they do,
    the reach afforded to them by their long wing arms is quite the surprise.
</p>
<p>
    While batlings lack the dexterity in their wing claws to use tools or weapons, they make up for this by living in swarms
    rivaling villages, towns and cities in scale. This, combined with their innate psionics and powerful voices, provides batlings
    with the ability to defend themselves.
</p>
<p>
    While batlings avoid martial pursuits, they have been known to become powerful psions or mages. Still common among batlings are
    those that pursue being bards or rogues. Some rare batlings have even managed to become maguses or their psionic equivalent.
