<h2 id="improved-grab">Improved Grab (Ex)</h2>
<p>
    To use this ability, a young, or older, aberration dragon must hit an opponent of up to its size with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple 
    as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can try to swallow the foe the 
    following round.
</p>

<h2 id="swallow-whole">Swallow Whole (Ex)</h2>
<p>
    A aberration dragon can try to swallow a grabbed opponent of up to one size smaller by making a successful grapple check. The swallowed creature 
    takes a bite attack worth of damage plus 1d6 acid damage per round. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing 
    weapon to deal one tenth the aberration dragon's hit points of damage to the inside of the mouth (AC 10 + ½ its natural armor bonus). Once the 
    creature exits, muscular action closes the mouth; another swallowed opponent must cut its own way out. An aberration dragon that has swallowed a 
    target can't use its bite attack until the swallowed creature is killed or escapes.
