<p>
    <i class="power">Strength Sight (Su):</i> A pophagite has the ability to see the strength of others, allowing the creature to determine the number of hit dice
    the creature has.
</p>
<p>
    <i class="power">Consume (Ex):</i> A pophagite is a creature of pure hunger and possesses the ability to consume another creature or corpse.
    As a full round action, a pophagite can eat a corpse of any size or a grappled creature of large size or smaller. If the creature is alive,
    they can attempt an attack of opportunity, which if successful protects the creature from being eaten, though the pophagite gets an immediate bite attack.
</p>
<p>
    If the pophagite consumes the corpse or creature successfully, the pophagite gains Regeneration 20 for a number of rounds equal to the hit dice of the
    consumed creature/corpse and a bonus to attack and damage equal to half the hit dice of the consumed creature/corpse until their Regeneration ends.
</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Pophagites are large, monstrous humanoids born exclusively from red queens that, much like the Red King, draw power from eating corpses. 
    They have tattered, bat-like wings (fly 90 ft. (good)) and gray, hairless flesh as well as a maw with rows of teeth and eyes all over 
    their head (360 degree vision).
</p>
<p>
    Pophagites won't attack members of the Cult of the Red King or the Red King's armies, but will eat them if they fall in battle. Pophagites also have the 
    ability to determine the power (hit dice) of a creature and only attack in groups when they spot creatures that are serious threats to a lone pophagite. 
    If a powerful human, or human blooded, attempts to open dialog with a pophagite, they usually will out of curiosity.
