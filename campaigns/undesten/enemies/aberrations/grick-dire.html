<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    A rare variety of grick only known to exist in the Deadlands, the dire grick is a massive individual measuring almost
    30 feet in length and massing in at 14 tons blessed not only with the outstanding strength expected of a creature its
    size, but also the ability to blend in with the urban terrain just as well as the far smaller standard grick. The kills
    this massive creature brings back to its nest draw in normal gricks as they scavenge what the dire grick leaves behind,
    their weapon resistant hides protecting them from the dire gricks attempts to drive its smaller kin off.
</p>
<p>
    Worse yet, the dire grick is notably smarter than its standard relatives, even if the tactics of ambushing targets
    remain the same.
</p>
<p>
    No one is certain if dire gricks are a different species or breed of grick, or if they are exceptional individuals able
    to grow to their outstanding size thanks to the influence of the Deadlands.
