<h2 id="icicle">Icicle (Sp)</h2>
<p>
    As a standard action, you can fire an icicle from your finger, targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged 
    touch attack. The icicle deals 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point for every two cleric levels you possess. 
    You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.

<h2 id="touch-of-darkness">Touch of Darkness (Sp)</h2>
<p>
    As a melee touch attack, you can cause a creature’s vision to be fraught with shadows and darkness. The creature 
    touched treats all other creatures as if they had concealment, suffering a 20% miss chance on all attack rolls. This 
    effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your cleric level (minimum 1). You can use this ability a number of 
    times per day equal to 3 + your Wisdom modifier.
