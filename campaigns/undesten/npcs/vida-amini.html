    Vida is driven to exterminate the gnolls that she believes plague the grasslands of Undesten. Her tribe, the Tarrokh, where wiped out
    by a gnoll attack, leaving her one of five survivors. While the others sought refuge with other tribes, Vida couldn't accept the chance
    that something like this could happen again, and has devoted herself to the elimination of the gnoll plague.
