<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Freydis is a 6' 4", 6 out of 10 human woman with straight chestnut hair that descends to just below her shoulders, pale skin,
    intense silvery blue eyes and E (DD) cup titties. She normally wears a black, linen crop-top with a long, loose right sleeve, a black linen skirt,
    a sturdy leather belt and boots, and an ample wool cloak with a hood. While in town, Freydis wears only a black silk choker with silver clasps and a small
    carnelian gem impeded in it and a flowing silver armband that mimics elven styling on her left arm. When traveling or expecting combat, Freydis
    wears a suit of Nerium scalemail with a leather breastplate over the torso armor with thick, sturdy white furs around the shoulders and belt.

<ap-auth-container permissions="gm undesten-full freydis-haukdottir-nerium-history">
    <p>
        Freydis acquired her nerium armor and sword from <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-iirie" hash="yeshana-black">Guildmaster Yeshana</ap-link-button>
        after hunting down several important members of the <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King's</ap-link-button> cult for her. Freydis is certain
        that <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-iirie" hash="yeshana-black">Yeshana</ap-link-button> was having her take out rivals within the cult,
        possibly proponents for other sects.

<p>
    Freydis is an intense and focused woman who expects others to fall in line and obey her without question, though she understands the need to reward
    good servants. Freydis's level of trust of a stranger is roughly equal to how much she expects them to be a hostile agent or a threat to her position.

<h2 id="history-and-motivation">History and Motivation</h2>
<p>
    Freydis hails from the mountains to the west of <ap-link-button linkName="arx">Arx</ap-link-button>, growing up in one of the many nomadic tribes that
    lived in that region. When Svala was 15, her tribe was attacked by goliaths which caused her to make for 
    <ap-link-button linkName="cuul">Cuul</ap-link-button>, where <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-svala-vikardottir">Svala</ap-link-button> would
    discover the slayer and begin testing her to she if she was worthy of joining the
    <ap-link-button linkName="noble-fallenfeather-sisterhood">Fallenfeather Sisterhood</ap-link-button>.
</p>
<p>
    Freydis passed the tests with flying colors, finding herself brought before <ap-link-button linkName="noble-akkus">Akkus</ap-link-button> and
    being inducted into the <ap-link-button linkName="noble-fallenfeather-sisterhood">Fallenfeather Sisterhood</ap-link-button>.
</p>
<p>
    Over her time in serving as a Fury of the <ap-link-button linkName="noble-fallenfeather-sisterhood">Fallenfeather Sisterhood</ap-link-button>,
    Freydis has become particularly close to <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-svala-vikardottir">Svala</ap-link-button>. Close enough that when
    <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-svala-vikardottir">Svala</ap-link-button> told her that she was going to be joining an expedition to
    <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-iirie">Iirie</ap-link-button>, Freydis didn't hesitate to leave everything behind to go with
    <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-svala-vikardottir">Svala</ap-link-button>.
</p>
<p>
    Freydis is driven by the hunt and her service to <ap-link-button linkName="noble-akkus">Akkus</ap-link-button>, but her strongest motivator
    is her love for <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-svala-vikardottir">Svala</ap-link-button>.
