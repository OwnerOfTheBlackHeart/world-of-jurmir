<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
	Pildrylth is a green dragon who stands at about 12 feet at the shoulder, when walking, and 55 feet from nose to tail. She lacks the
	typical crest of a green dragon, instead having 2 curving front horns with six straight horns behind her head and a "beard" of spines
	on the underside of her jaw. While the scales on Pildrylth's back are visible, her chest and wings are covered in vines and moss.
</p>
<p>
	Pildrylth moves with a regal grace and speaks in either a sing-songy voice or with a commanding, echoing one. 
</p>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm pildrylth-personality noble-full">
    <p>
		Pildrylth is a tactical and sneaky dragon who likes to feel like a queen. She takes great pleasure in expanding her power through
		proxies and monitoring her "enemies" using spies while having her direct subordinates form her queendom (she is still debating on
		if it is a queendom for an empire). When dealing with other creatures, Pildrylth likes to see smaller creatures cower, kneel, or 
		otherwise show great fear or respect. Pildrylth is very careful not to allow untrusted creatures to find her capital burrow.

	<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
	<p>
		Pildrylth likes to start fights hidden, using her breath weapon to unleash as much damage to as many enemies as possible. She will then use
		this first assault to judge her enemies. If they are weak, she will storm them herself, trying to break them up and kill them as efficiently
		as possible. If the enemy is stronger, she will retreat back into the forest to hide while her minions attack, allowing Pildrylth to either
		maneuver to cut off escape or to attack the easiest members of the enemies to kill.
	</p>
	<p>
		Pildrylth normally travels with 10 kobolds who serve to screen her from smaller threats while moving, scout ahead, and to attack enemies she 
		has engaged. Her screening force is usually 8, or so, strong and made up of rangers, rogues, and sorcerers with 2 scouts moving ahead to keep
		the party from being ambushed and keep them informed of what lies ahead.
	</p>
	<p>
		Pildrylth prefers to travel via water, as she views it as far safer than traveling by land or air.

	<h2 id="history-and-motivation">History and Motivation</h2>
    <p>
		Pildrylth hatched in her forest on Durnio 15th, 1445 (77 as of Durnio 28th, 1522) surrounded by the 
		<ap-link-button linkName="noble-hidden-pond-clan">Hidden Pond</ap-link-button> kobold clan, who viewed the finding of her egg as a sign from 
		Kyranious and fed the ego and will to rule of Pildrylth, while simultaneously teaching her of her own weaknesses and the rewards of going 
		unnoticed. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Pildrylth has lead the Hidden Pond clan since her 5th year, using the lessons they have taught her to create a small network of knowledge as well as
		establish proxies within the forest, only fueling her will to be a proper ruler. She has established locations throughout her forest that she
		can meet with people without having to expose her burrow as well as methods to ensure that such locations remain safe.

<ap-auth-container permissions="gm pildrylth-motivation noble-full">
    <p>
		Pildrylth intends to create an actual empire of her own, with as many loyal subjects as possible, and then kill off the surrounding
		elves and take any survivers to farm as food. She believes that all the forests of Taaira Ruzara belong to her by right of the gods.
		She also wants to know the secrets of the elven silver-steel (mithral) because she believes her people will be able to make much better
		use of it than the elves.
