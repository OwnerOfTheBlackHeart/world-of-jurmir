<h3 id="ice-strike">Ice Strike (Su)</h3>
<p>
    At 1st level, Ragna can touch one weapon and enhance it with the power of water. For 1 minute, this weapon glows with a blue-white chill 
    and deals an additional 1d4 points of cold damage with each strike. This additional damage doesn’t stack with the additional damage 
    from the frost or icy burst weapon special abilities.
</p>

<h3 id="double">Double (Su)</h3>
<p>
    At 1st level, as a move action Ragna can create an illusory double of herself. This double functions as a single mirror image, and lasts for 
    a number of rounds equal to her warpriest level, or until the illusory duplicate is dispelled or destroyed. She can have no more than one
    double at a time. The double created by this ability doesn’t stack with the additional images from the mirror image spell. This ability 
    doesn’t stack with the additional damage from the mirror image spell.
</p>

<h3 id="armor-of-ice">Armor of Ice (Su)</h3>
<p>
    At 10th level, Ragna can touch any one ally and wreath it in freezing mist. This works as fire shield (chill shield only) with a duration 1 minute.
</p>

<h3 id="greater-invisibility">Greater Invisibility (Su)</h3>
<p>
    At 10th level, as a swift action Ragna can become invisible for 1 round (as greater invisibility).
</p>

<h3 id="hard-to-kill">Hard to Kill (Ex)</h3>
<p>
    Whenever Ragna's below 0 hit points, she automatically stabilizes without needing to attempt a Constitution check. If she have an ability that allows 
    her to act while below 0 hit points, she will still lose hit points for taking actions, as specified by that ability. Bleed damage still causes her to 
    lose hit points when below 0 hit points. In addition, she don’t die until her total number of negative hit points is equal to or greater than 
    double her Constitution score.
</p>

<h3 id="amazing-initiative">Amazing Initiative (Ex)</h3>
<p>
    At 2nd tier, Ragna gains a bonus on initiative checks equal to her mythic tier. In addition, as a free action on her turn, she can expend one use of mythic 
    power to take an additional standard action during that turn. This additional standard action can’t be used to cast a spell. She can’t gain an extra action 
    in this way more than once per round.

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Ragna is a 4' 9", 8 out of 10 human-like woman with two large fox ears, 8 tails, black fur that ends in white tips, ass-length black hair either left to flow
    freely or tied into a ponytail, arms and hands that look constantly frostbitten and E (DD) cup titties. She normally wears a very nice belt with a basic black 
    skirt and a linen strip binder that looks like bandages. When traveling among civilization, she will also wear a set of fine robes, a pair of boots and wraps 
    her arms in matching bandage strips.

<ap-auth-container permissions="gm undesten-full ragna-namkidottir-outfit-history">
    <p>
        Ragna wears little clothing because she believes that doing so keeps her closer to both the ancient nature of her people and the elemental powers
        she serves.
    </p>
</ap-auth-container>
<p>
    Ragna is a confident, if demeaning, woman driven to see her goals completed that is... detached and uncaring towards those she views as strangers;
    However, those that can manage to become her friend will find a caring and playful creature.
</p>

<h2 id="history-and-motivation">History and Motivation</h2>
<p>
    Ragna has always been a scholar of ancient history, trying to understand the world as it was before the birth of the gods. Through her research,
    Ragna discovered artifacts and writings that <i>suggested</i> that kitsune were the first humanoid race, predate the gods, and that all other races were based on them.
    Taking this information at face value, Ragna has come to believe that the primordials should be released from their prisons and return Jurmir to
    the way it was before the gods.
