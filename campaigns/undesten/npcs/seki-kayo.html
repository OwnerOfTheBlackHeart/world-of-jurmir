<p>
    At the start of their turn, a Hellhound can designate a single enemy as their target. All allies with Pack Tactics, including the Hellhound herself, 
    gains a +1 moral bonus to attack and damage rolls against the target, up to +5 to attack and damage.

    Due to their inherently chaotic nature and acclimation to constant overstimulation, Silverwolves ignore the alignment restrictions of the Paladin and Monk classes.

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Kayo is a 5' 6", 8 out of 10 female <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-zoes-hounds" hash="silverwolf">silverwolf</ap-link-button> with back length white hair this 
    has the bangs hanging free while the rest of the hair is tied into either a ponytail or pigtail, red eyes, pale skin, and C cup titties.
    She normally wears a plain, undyed sleeveless linen crop-top and a matching knee-length skirt with a pair of plain leather sandals and a basic hooded leather
    cloak. When prepared for combat, Kayo wears her black combat body glove with extra red ceramic plates on the arms and calves, along with baggy black pants
    and a red sash.
</p>
<p>
    Kayo is a curious, confident, energetic and uncaring woman all at the same time, who seeks to serve her mistress Zoe to her fullest. She seems to be on a constant
    hunt, seeking information and items that can further the ends of the <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-zoes-hounds">Heck's Hounds</ap-link-button>, or even
    her own personal agenda. She has a plan to kill everyone she meets. She is currently serving as
    <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-yanaba">Yanaba's</ap-link-button> handler.

    <li>Kayo is a feminine hermaphrodite with an 8" penis</li>
    <li>Kayo is on some kind of scouting mission, and has decided to focus it on figuring out the utility of this world's magic</li>
    <li>Kayo is something called a Silverwolf, and that somehow entitles her to leadership of scouting missions</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="history-and-motivation">History and Motivation</h2>
<p>
    Kayo hails from the planet Xarnin, specifically from Yamasato in the Togawa Shogunate, Fujinai. Originally working as a servant of the local daimyo,
    Kayo was recruited as part of Zoe Von Nalbalgrab's program to collect all the wolf people of Xarnin and "free" them from the local dragons. After a
    short training and indoctrination program, Kayo began loyally serving Zoe and Heck's Hounds as an infiltrator and spy.
</p>
<p>
    Kayo came to Undesten as a scout for the <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-zoes-hounds">Heck's Hounds</ap-link-button>, to see if the world had
    work and the effective means to make such work worthwhile.

    <p>
        Kayo is actually investigating the general usefulness of Undesten for conquest. She views the world as mostly useless, though the powerful magic
        and seemingly different rules that the creatures in Undesten follow interest her, especially magic items and the gods. A member of Zoe's Cult of the
        <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button>, the existence of a second <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button>
        intrigues her and she seeks to find a way to allow Zoe to consume him and his power.
