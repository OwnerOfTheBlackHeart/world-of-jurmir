<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Yabu is a 5' 10", 7 out of 10 female drow <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-zoes-hounds" hash="hellhound">hellhound</ap-link-button> with upper back length black hair
    that drapes down and bangs that normally cover her right eye, red eyes, purple-black skin and D cup titties. She normally wears a binder styled to look like jaws
    over her breasts with a black furred cape that covers her shoulders and hangs down to her ass, a belted loincloth with black furred hides that cover her outer thighs,
    and small black gloves. When prepared for combat, Yabu braids her bangs to keep them out of her eyes and wears a black body glove under her normal clothes.
</p>
<p>
    Yabu is a strong willed woman who serves her masters, the <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-zoes-hounds">Heck's Hounds</ap-link-button> at the moment, with zeal. 
    While she may act servile when dealing with those she views as superiors, she does not extend such courtesy to those not in her chain of command and relishes having 
    control over others. However, those inferiors of hers that prove capable and obedient, or even just properly respectful, will have a notably easier time dealing 
    with her. To those completely detach from her organization, they are treated according to what she seeks from them, which is typically coldly without any expectation
    of usefulness.

<h2 id="history-and-motivation">History and Motivation</h2>
<p>
    Yabu was born underground and served as a member of her house's guard until superior turned against her house. Yabu attempted to kill her superior for betraying
    their house, but Yabu was defeated and enslaved, kept only long enough to see said superior take over their house by force before being sold to the surface.
    On the surface at <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-grass-foot-tribe" hash="coal-bin">Coal Bin</ap-link-button> by Yuru and given to
    <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-seki-kayo">Seki Kayo</ap-link-button>.
</p>
<p>
    Brought into the <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-zoes-hounds">Heck's Hounds</ap-link-button> by <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-seki-kayo">Kayo</ap-link-button>,
    Yabu was given the <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-zoes-hounds" hash="hellhound">hellhound</ap-link-button> and Unitarian Dunk. Recognizing that she had been fully
    inducted into the <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-zoes-hounds">Hounds</ap-link-button>, Yabu has devoted herself fully to them and their cause.
</p>
<p>
    While Yabu despises <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-seki-kayo">Kayo</ap-link-button> personally, she serves her faithfully and loyally as
    <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-seki-kayo">Kayo</ap-link-button> is her superior. Yabu seeks to perform well enough to be freed from
    <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-seki-kayo">Kayo's</ap-link-button> yoke and to be given a command of her own.
