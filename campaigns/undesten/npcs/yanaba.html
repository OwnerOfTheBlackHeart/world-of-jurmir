<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Yanaba is a 4' 9", 8 out of 10 female <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-zoes-hounds">hellhound</ap-link-button> with thick, back length brown hair,
    golden eyes, lightly tanned skin and D cup titties. She normally wears a sleeveless red crop-top with a long, brown parted dress bottom and sturdy
    boots, along with several belts and pouches for collecting items that interest her.
</p>
<p>
    Yanaba is a friendly, if occasionally cold, woman fully devoted to the cause of the <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-zoes-hounds">Heck's Hounds</ap-link-button>
    and her mistress Zoe. She is motivated by two things: Her orders and her own comfort, though she will sacrifice for, and look out for, other members of the
    <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-zoes-hounds">Heck's Hounds</ap-link-button>. <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-seki-kayo">Seki Kayo</ap-link-button>
    is serving as her current handler.
</p>

<h2 id="history-and-motivation">History and Motivation</h2>
<p>
    Yanaba hails from the planet Xarnin, specifically from among the Tribes of Memdi. Originally a slave traded among tribes, Yanaba was bought by a representative
    of the <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-zoes-hounds">Heck's Hounds</ap-link-button> and allowed to go free. The 
    <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-zoes-hounds">Heck's Hounds</ap-link-button> made her an offer upon her freedom of joining up and serving with the
    <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-zoes-hounds">Heck's Hounds</ap-link-button> among the stars. Yanaba didn't hesitate to join, and breezed through the
    indoctrination program with flying colors, though she struggled with the combat training due to her magical background.
</p>
<p>
    Yanaba came to Undesten as a scout for the <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-zoes-hounds">Heck's Hounds</ap-link-button>, to see if the world had
    work and the effective means to make such work worthwhile.
