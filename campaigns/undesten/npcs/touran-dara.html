<h3 id="acid-injection">Acid Injection (Ex)</h3>
<p>
    When Touran strikes an opponent with her spikes, she injects a burning, irritating acid that deals 1d4 points of acid damage immediately 
    and another 1d4 points of acid damage on the round after the attack. The target can end the acidâ€™s effects by submerging the wound in 
    water for a round or by being treated with a DC 15 Heal check. A creature that grapples or swallows Touran takes this acid damage 
    automatically every round she maintains this contact with a living Touran.
</p>

<h3 id="stench-spray">Stench Spray (Ex)</h3>
<p>
    Touran can spray a 20-foot line of foul-smelling liquid once every 1d4 rounds. This spray functions like the stench universal monster 
    ability, except it only affects creatures struck by the spray, which must make a DC 19 Fortitude save or be sickened for 5 rounds. The 
    save DC is Constitution-based. Alternatively, Touran can concentrate the spray on a single target within 5 feet. To use this version 
    of her stench spray, Touran must succeed at a ranged touch attack (+12). If the target is hit, it must make a DC 19 
    Fortitude save or become nauseated for 5 rounds; otherwise, it is sickened for 5 rounds. The odor from this spray lingers in the area and 
    on all creatures struck for 1d4 hours, and can be detected at a range of 100 feet (creatures with the scent ability can smell it at double this range).
</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Touran is a 6' 5" woman that looks like a beautiful human woman floating about, with long dark hair, a pleasant form, tanned skin and a 
    long, tail-like tentacle that ends in a series of small spikes. She wears a simple dress made of an unknown, but quite fine, fabric that 
    changes color according to her mood or whims.
</p>
<p>
    Touran is followed around by a flumph named Latif that is her first born. He is trying to get Touran to be a better person, as well as
    produce more flumphs, and other good aberrations, so that they can work to protect against all peoples from
    the <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button>.
</p>

<h2 id="history-and-motivation">History and Motivation</h2>
<p>
    Touran was originally a ratfolk living in dwarf city after dwarf city, suffering under the boot of the strict and stoic people, and constantly
    made to feel weak. Touran turned first to <ap-link-button linkName="kyranious">Kyranious</ap-link-button> for strength and power, but found her
    followers to be little more than bullies that demanded strength rather than granting it, so Touran turned to the 
    <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button>. She soon found her way to 
    <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-fallen-amid">Fallen Amid</ap-link-button> with the hope of becoming human, not because she truly believed in
    the cult's expectation of the end of the gods, but because becoming human would solve her inferiorities.
</p>
<p>
    In the end, she submitted to the ritual to bear the offspring of the <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button> and managed
    to survive... only to give birth to a flump, something small, weak and pathetic. This caused her to leave 
    <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-fallen-amid">Fallen Amid</ap-link-button> before the rest of the cultists there could figure out what happened.
    Now once more "weak" and denied the opportunity to have ready made importance, while also being constantly followed by her annoying first born,
    Touran is at a crossroads as to what to do with her life now.
