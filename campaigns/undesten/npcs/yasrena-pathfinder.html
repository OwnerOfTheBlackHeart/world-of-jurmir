<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Yasrena is 5' 2" tall and 117 lbs in weight with white hair, human-like ice-blue eyes, light coal skin, and sharp features. She usually wears her hair in a 
    large ponytail with two "strips" of hair on either side of her face. She typically wears a black leather shirt that leaves her flanks and upper back exposed 
    with matching gloves and leggings, which others may consider sexually explicit while Yasrena considers it a show of confidence in herself. When traveling or
    expecting danger, Yasrena adds a pair of metal gauntlets and metal heeled boots.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
    In combat, Yasrena likes to start fights at a range, using her spells to create an initial advantage and act as artillery against her enemies. Once she is 
    satisfied with the amount of damage she has dealt to her enemies, Yasrena will dive in to finish off her enemies with her enchanted bloodstone blade.
</p>
<p>
    If her enemies engage Yasrena before she has a chance to cast her spells, she will fight with her sword and melee spells (if she has them prepared).
</p>

<h2 id="history-and-motivation">History and Motivation</h2>
<p>
    Yasrena was born underground in the drow city of Amnoranis (beautiful guide) with purple eyes. She was born into a relatively low birth, taking up the sword 
    as a means of sustaining herself. As she served her superior drowesses, Yasrena founder herself slowly being drawn to the Sister of Sithrak, Kriotz, much to 
    the distaste of those around her.
</p>
<p>
    Eventually, Yasrena found that she was no longer welcome among the drow and left before they could have a chance to sacrifice her to the magics that seal the 
    void. Following the visions given to her by Kriotz, Yasrena escaped to the surface, where she now roams from place to place while carefully avoiding settlements.
</p>
<p>
    She now seeks knowledge and magic, on a pilgrimage to ancient ruins and holy sites of Kriotz. Yasrena is also looking for tools with which to protect her from 
    those drow houses who might still hunt her. Eventually, she would like to find a place that she could safely settle down and worship the Goddess of Knowledge and Magic.
