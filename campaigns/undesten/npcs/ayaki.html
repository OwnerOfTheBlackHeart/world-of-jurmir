            Svala commonly works with
            <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-freydis-haukdottir">Freydis</ap-link-button>, who is her "<i>main</i>" fury
        </li>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Svala is a 5' 6", 8 out of 10 human woman with short, dark red hair, pale skin, dark blue eyes and D cup titties. 
    She normally wears her enchanted, black spider-silk bodysuit with a dark red, hooded, crop-top poncho with loose sleeves and white floral designs, and a matching 
    skirt over the bodysuit while a pair of sturdy boots guard her feet. Svala doesn't wear consistent jewelry, but it is normally humble compared
    to her attire.
</p>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm undesten-full ayaki-outfit-history">
    <p>
        Svala's outfit comes from a variety of sources, with the bodyglove having been made for her by her mentor, a drow woman named Vanos Aerqon
        who served as the chief Kata for <ap-link-button linkName="cuul">Cuul</ap-link-button>, when Svala told her she would be leaving for 
        <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-iirie">Iirie</ap-link-button>, while the poncho and skirt were stolen from a passing
        <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-ming">Ming</ap-link-button> trader.
    </p>
</ap-auth-container>
<p>
    Svala is a curious, confident and focused woman who is always looking for an edge and a chance to build her network. She is cautious with strangers and
    friends alike, always ready for betrayal, but quick to put on a convincing smile if the situation calls for it.
</p>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm undesten-full ayaki-sex">
    <p>
        Svala is a feminine hermaphrodite with an 8" penis.

<h2 id="history-and-motivation">History and Motivation</h2>
<p>
    Svala hails from <ap-link-button linkName="ashborne">Ashborne</ap-link-button>, where she was born and raised by parents that only had children so they
    could give them chores to perform. During her time living with her parents, Svala learned both how to manipulate and how to spot when she was being
    manipulated, but also how to act without drawing the attention of her parents, so as to avoid doing <i>their</i> chores.
</p>
<p>
    When Svala was old enough, she began traveling around Lyrna, eventually meeting Vanos Aerqon. Vanos helped Svala refine the talents living with her parents
    had taught her, as well as a few other tricks of spycraft, before subtly testing Svala, which Svala quickly noticed. Knowing that it was best to perform
    averagely, Svala did exactly that, passing the tests well enough to be brought before <ap-link-button linkName="noble-akkus">Akkus</ap-link-button>
    and inducted into the <ap-link-button linkName="noble-fallenfeather-sisterhood">Fallenfeather Sisterhood</ap-link-button>.
</p>
<p>
    After 3 years of operating with the <ap-link-button linkName="noble-fallenfeather-sisterhood">Sisterhood</ap-link-button>, Svala was chosen to join the
    expedition to <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-iirie">Iirie</ap-link-button> to aid in forming a cell within Undesten. A year in, and the Undesten
    <ap-link-button linkName="noble-fallenfeather-sisterhood">Fallenfeather Sisterhood</ap-link-button> cell has settled comfortably in the area and Svala
    intends to get it acting and expanding.
