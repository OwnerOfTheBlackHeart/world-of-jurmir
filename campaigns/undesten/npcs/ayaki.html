<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Ikaya is a 5' 9" tall, 6 out of 10 human woman with flowing, ass-length reddish-brown hair, lightly tanned yellowish skin, orange-brown eyes and E (DD) titties.
    Ikaya typically wears a loose, white shirt with a black vest that barely covers her cleavage, a pair of thin, tight shorts, black knee-high boots,
    and a green sash that she wears like a belt. She may occasionally wear bone, wood and leather jewelry, but shies away from metal ornamentation.
    She carries an earth breaker on her back.
</p>
<p>
    Ikaya is a friendly and expressive, if at times cold, woman who enjoys entertaining others, spreading joy and being among nature.
    She is quick to establish boundaries and respect those put up by others, and has no interest in disrupting the cultures of others,
    which she enjoys studying the arts of.
</p>

<h2 id="history-and-motivation">History and Motivation</h2>
<p>
    Ikaya is from a village hidden deep in the jungles of Undesten, one whose location she will not speak of, which she left as a means to
    better serve and understand her god, Perform. Along the way, she has fallen in love with the arts of the various cultures, especially those
    of <ap-link-button linkName="undesten-iirie">Iirie</ap-link-button>, whose melting pot of cultures lets her study several at once.
