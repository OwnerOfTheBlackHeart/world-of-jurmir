<h1>Crash of the Red Raven</h1>
<p>
    A transport ship carrying passengers and cargo was passing by the jungle planet of Voqua when it is shot
    down. As the ship falls from the sky, those who manage to get to escape pods are killed as they eject from
    the Red Raven. Among the survivors or the crash are the party, who are rapidly being approached by hostile 
    forces and seperated from their equipment by halls of the ship and those enemies that have managed to enter
    the remains of the Red Raven.

    <h3>Getting Shot Down</h3>
    <p>
        The transport ship Red Raven is passing through the orbit of the planet Voqua when it is suddenly attacked
        by a fleet of black, smooth ships. All escape pods are launched before the party can get in them and the 
        Red Raven crashes into the planet. All characters awaken with only a few minutes to try and get ready for 
        oncoming enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
        The party has around 5 minutes after waking up.
    </p>
    <h3>Acquire Equipment</h3>
    <p>
        Alive, awake and aware, the individual members of the party are seperated. All know that their starting
        gear is within the cargo hold of the Red Raven. Each party member will have 2 <ap-link-button linkName="sbj-security-forces">
        security guards</ap-link-button> with them at the start of this stage. Each party member will have to deal
        with 3 patrols of 2 hobgoblin troopers each, in whatever manner they can.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once all three characters have made it through, they meet in the cargo hold and collect their gear.
    </p>

    <h3>Find the X Saber</h3>
    <p>
        Once all the characters and the remaining <ap-link-button linkName="sbj-security-forces">security guards</ap-link-button>
        are equiped, two drow walk in. If any of the characters speak elvish or undercommon, they will understand the drow talking
        about looking for a spaceship.
    </p>
    <p>
        After defeating the drow, the party can find a datapad that details an experimental spaceship in the hangar bay.
    </p>

    <h3>Escape the Drow</h3>
    <p>
        The party can either run out on foot and try to escape into the jungle or take the X Saber. If they take the X Saber, they
        will have to fight 2 <ap-link-button linkName="sbj-drow-fighter">drow fighters</ap-link-button> and one BMC Mauler.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once they have jumped out of system, continue on to <ap-link-button linkName="sbj-x-saber-plot">the X Saber mission</ap-link-button>.
