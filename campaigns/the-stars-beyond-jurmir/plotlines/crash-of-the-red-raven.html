<h1>Crash of the Red Raven</h1>
<p>
    A transport ship carrying passengers and cargo was passing by the jungle planet of Voqua when it is shot
    down. As the ship falls from the sky, those who manage to get to escape pods are killed as they eject from
    the Red Raven. Among the survivors or the crash are the party, who are rapidly being approached by hostile 
    forces and seperated from their equipment by halls of the ship and those enemies that have managed to enter
    the remains of the Red Raven.
