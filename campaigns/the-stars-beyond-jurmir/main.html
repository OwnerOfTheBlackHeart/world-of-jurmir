<h1>Beyond the world of Jurmir lies countless stars</h1>
<p>
    2,000 years after the adventures of Aaron the races of the world of Jurmir have expanded
    beyond their native garden world, but 50 years since a great calamaty struck. Known as
    the Gap, the calamaty began with the disappearance of almost half of humanity as well as
    the plane known as the Void and large portions of history (which were ripped straight from
    peoples' memories, books, and computers).
</p> 
<p>
    For the most part, the galaxy has healed from the Gap, but many long lived races struggle
    to move past the significant losses of their pasts. Shorter lived species like humans have
    begun moving forward, leaving the longer lived races to stay stagnant in their lost pasts.
