<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	Lady Ophre Nyldreesh of House Duskryn is a tall and slender drow noble with
	waist length, pale lavender hair and dark red eyes that appear like blood rubies.
	She wears the typical black armor of the drow, but has it custom fit to show
	off her elegant form. She always has at least two males guarding her at any time.

	<p>
		Ophre tries to be approachable and friendly, but can quickly turn to anger when
		she is being inconvenienced. When dealing with male drow, she doesn't hesitate to
		punish any failure or misbehavior, but with outsiders she will try to seem caring,
		especially if the outsiders have a good track record with her.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the end, Ophre seeks to discover what is happening with the Red King and the
		Gap. She is also heavily motivated by money, as she can use it to help advance
		her goals.
