<h1>Ericson Class Scout Frigate</h1>
<p>
	The Ericson Class Scout Frigate is a tried and true stealth frigate 
	designed to trap and sabotage enemy positions with 2 iterations.
	The first offers almost no armor or shields in exchange for being able
	to deploy troops or lay fields of mines. The second iteration can only
	lay mines or deploy troops on any given mission, but includes defensive
	weapons and light armor and shielding.

<p>
	The Ericson Class gets its name from Erik Ericson a human believed
	to be the first companion of Aaron Dobbs (though historians debate whether it was
	Chione of Ashborne or Erik who was the first companion). Erik is know for
	having, single handedly, defended the fortress Oasis from a back to back
	invasion of goblins then gnolls.
