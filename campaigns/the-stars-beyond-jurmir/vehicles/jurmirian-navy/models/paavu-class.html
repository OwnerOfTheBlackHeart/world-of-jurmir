<h1>Paavu Class Heavy Frigate</h1>
<p>
	The Paavu Class Heavy Frigate is a design that was first created when advanced
	nano-bot controllers were developed. The design of the hull, the nano-bots, and 
	control computers have been updated a total of 4 times (5 total versions) since
	the inception of this design.

<p>
	The Paavu Class Heavy Frigate is named after the ancient cannibal Paavu Flesheater 
	Ogolakanu, who was the physically strongest companion of Aaron Dobbs during the
	expansion of Lyrna. Much like its namesake, the Paavu Class can consume its enemies
	once they have been killed/disabled.

<p>
	When a Paavu Class Heavy Frigate enters a hex that contains a disabled ship or portion
	of a disabled ship, it can spend the round consuming the ship. The Paavu Class gains
	10% of the consumed ship's maximum hit points at the start of its next turn and the
	consumed ship can not longer be consumed or salvaged for anything more than near
	worthless scrap metal.
