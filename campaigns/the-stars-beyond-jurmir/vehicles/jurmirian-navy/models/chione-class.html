<h1>Chione Class Destroyer</h1>
<p>
	The Chione Class Destroyer is named after Chione of Ashborne, a tiefling believed
	to be the first companion of Aaron Dobbs (though historians debate whether it was
	Chione or Erik Ericson who was the first companion). The Chione Class is a relatively
	new design in space warfare that focuses on devastating long range missiles/torpedoes.

<p>
	The Chione Class was given its name due to the stories of Chione of Ashborne telling
	of her striking with lightning coursing through her weapon, potentially making her
	strike more powerful than that of Paavu's, and how the Chione Class launches a field
	or torpedoes and missiles that can threaten even ships beyond its own class.
