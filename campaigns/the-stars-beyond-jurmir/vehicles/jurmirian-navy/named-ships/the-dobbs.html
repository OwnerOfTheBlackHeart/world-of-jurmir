<h1>The JMS Dobbs</h1>
<p>
	A powerful mix of a battleship and a carrier, the JMS Dobbs is the
	flagship of the Jurmirian 12th Scout Fleet, which patrols across the
	Colonies and Outer Colonies regions in times of peace or scouts enemy
	fleets and planets during times of war.
</p>
<p>
	The Dobbs is named after the general, Aaron Dobbs, who rooted out Red 
	King worship within the ancient city of Seablood (a story often recounted
	with a theme of vigilance) and who lead a band of irregulars that served
	as the spearhead of Arx during the expansion of Lyrna.
</p>
<p>
	The 12th fleet rarely has more than 4 of the same starship within it at
	any given time, often times travelling disguised as a trading convoy.
