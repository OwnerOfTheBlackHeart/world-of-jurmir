<h1>The JMS Zita Lethos, Pride of Jurmir</h1>
<p>
	The JMS Zita Lethos is the largest battleship in all of the Jurmirian Coalition and
	is the center piece of the Jurmirian Navy. Due to her size and power, the Zita serves
	in whatever fleet needs her power most, whether it be the 7th fleet during the siege of
	Vesk 20 or the 3rd fleet during the 2nd battle of <ap-link-button linkName="sbj-starblood">
	Starblood</ap-link-button>. The Zita is currently stationed with the 1st fleet protecting
	Jurmir herself.

<p>
	The JMS Zita Lethos is named after Zita, the Speaker of Durn, and her loyal body guard
	Lethos, the Lion of Arx. Zita is often hailed as the Speaker who laid the groundwork for
	what would become the Jurmirian Coalition and for bringing civilization to what would
	become the continent of Lyrna. Lethos is credited in the name of the ship because of his
	loyalty to Zita as well as his legendary strength, ferocity, and endurance that the designers
	of the Zita Lethos hopped would complement the massive battleship.
