<h1>The Sections of the Galaxy</h1>
<p>
	The galaxy is broken into 16 sections, known as sectors, which serve as
	both general areas of space and measures of general FTL distance. Most 
	of the borders of the sectors are actual barriers that slow FTL travel,
	often making it faster to go from one end of a sector to its opposite end
	than to cross the border into another sector.
</p>
<p>
	The sectors are the Jurmirian Zone, the Expansion Zone, the Colonies, the Outer Colonies,
	Vesk Sectors 1, 2, and 3, the Deep Sectors 1, 2, and 3, the Mass Wilds, the Coronal Turbulence,
	the Silence, the Madness, the Never Seen, and the Cold Dark.
