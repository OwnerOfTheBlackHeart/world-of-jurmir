    Voqua is a jungle world within the colonies region that most races have ignored in favor of more valuable
    worlds. The hobgoblins, however, landed on the planet with their arc ship and quickly established a military 
    holding on the world. While the jungles are mostly untamed and the planet is considered safe to fly by, several
    hobgoblin bases dot the surface with fighters on standby for if a potential threat gets too close.

<p>
    The jungles themselves are extremely thick, requiring the local hobgoblins to use walkers and aerial vehicles.
    Hidden within the canapy of the 600+ foot tall trees are countless dangerious plants and animals waiting to
    kill any unprotected organic fool enough to get close to them.
