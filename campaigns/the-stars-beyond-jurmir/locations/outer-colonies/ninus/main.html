	Within the Ninus solar system are two major worlds: Ninus 5, a tropical world known for a booming agricultural 
	industry as well as the raddest waves in the Outer Colonies, and Ninus 8, a relatively cold world with rich ore
	deposits and easy access to Ninus's asteroid belt. Ninus 8 serves as the major industrial and military center for 
	the Ninus system, housing all production deemed to dangerous to be done on Ninus 5 as well as large amounts of 
	production with convenient access to materials.
