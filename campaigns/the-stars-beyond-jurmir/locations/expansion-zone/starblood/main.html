<p>
	Starblood is a desolate world that is only barely livable and surrounded by several planets
	the wouldn't be considered for colonization, or even terraforming, in the most dire of situations.
	The only reason that the planet is inhabited is because the dangerous environments of the
	planet and its surrounding space make the perfect place for military weapons testing and
	special forces training. As such, almost exclusively military personal inhabit the planet.
