<p>
	Jurmir is the homeworld of the races known as the Jurmirian species (human, elf, dwarf, halfling, gnome, etc.)
	as well as several races of monsters (orc, gnoll, drow, etc.). Before the Gap, Jurmir was also the only known way
	to enter the Void. It is a beautiful world that has a mix of protected nature preserves and gleaming cities.
	It also serves as the capital of the Jurmirian Coalition and primary military power with its many colonies.
