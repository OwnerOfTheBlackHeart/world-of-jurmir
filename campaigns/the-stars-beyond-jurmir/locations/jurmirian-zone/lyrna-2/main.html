	Founded by a group of durnites following a prophet who had a vision of a world
	perfect for a monastery, Lyrna 2 is a planet known for its many temples, shrines,
	and places of study. The planet is mostly grasslands with sturdy, supporting soil
	and calm weather that allows buildings to last seemingly forever with little decay.

	Lyrna 2 is slightly off of 3 different trade routes, allowing it to easily acquire
	needed materials while avoiding attention or particularly heavy trade, and especially
	piracy.

<p>
	Of the locations and institutions on Lyrna 2 that attract those less religious
	than the average pilgrim, the Great Temple of Kriotz is the most famous, being an
	institution where magic is taught, practiced, and sold. Another common attraction
	to the less religious is the village sized Hipha School of Technology, the highest
	rated public university in the Jurmirian Coalition.
