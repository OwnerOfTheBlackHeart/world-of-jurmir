Determine statistics for nen
	What plasma weapons would they use

Determine where the Aeons live
	Did the Aeon empire exist before the Gap?
		No
		Perhaps the missing humans are a part of the Aeon Empire
		The Aeon Empire is lead by Queen Suda Sangsorn, who used the Gap to cast a powerful spell to bring her new worshipers of the Red King

What caused the Gap
	The loss of knowledge is due to the death of Lagos and the rising of a new time god 
		Several powerful spells and rituals that shouldn't have existed yet were cast in the midst of the Gap
		While most believe that the Gap was instantaneous, it was actually 20 years long
	Does the Void still exist?
		The Red King?
	Has the Void been moved?
		Yes
	Has the Red King awoken?
		Partially
		Some of Spec's female friends are Red Queens?
		Or other red King servants?
	Did the Red King take the humans with him?
