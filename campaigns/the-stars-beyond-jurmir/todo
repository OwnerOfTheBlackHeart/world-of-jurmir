		The Aeon Empire is lead by Queen Suda Sangsorn, who used the Gap to cast a powerful spell to bring her new worshipers of the Red King

What caused the Gap
	The loss of knowledge is due to the death of Lagos and the rising of a new time god 
		Several powerful spells and rituals that shouldn't have existed yet were cast in the midst of the Gap
		While most believe that the Gap was instantaneous, it was actually 20 years long
	Does the Void still exist?
		The Red King?
	Has the Void been moved?
	Has the Red King awoken?
