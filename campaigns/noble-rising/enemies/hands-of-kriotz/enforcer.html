<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	This elven warrior of Kriotz wears a purple chainshirt with pale blue leathers beneath it. The elf carries a heavy wooden shield
	that they can quickly dispose of if needed.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
	The Kriotz enforcer would rather attack from a range, trying to mitigate the opportunity for closer range spells to be used against
	them. If needed, or if a priest is nearby, the enforcer will move to melee range.
