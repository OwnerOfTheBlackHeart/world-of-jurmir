<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    This hobgoblin stands proud in his well kept breastplate. With a shining longsword and a wooden shield, this hobgoblin
    challenges you to fight him.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
    Hobgoblin sergeants lead their forces through their own strength. While almost incapable of stealth within their armor,
    hobgoblin sergeants understand the importance of an ambush and will often act as bait, or wait in a dug in position until
    the fight has started.
</p>
<p>
    Hobgoblin sergeants love to lead their troops from the front, forming a barrier against the enemy that allows their troops
    to manuever.
