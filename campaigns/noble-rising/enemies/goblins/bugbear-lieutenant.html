<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    This bugbear rests on its haunches, its body tensed and ready to strike. It watches carefully with a shortsword in each hand.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
    There is nothing that makes a bugbear lieutenant happier that a well executed ambush. They prefer to hide and have their underlings do the same,
    rising from their positions to launch a large mass attack onto their prey. Once in open combat, bugbear lieutenants look to flank their enemies.
</p>
<p>
    If a bugbear lieutenant spots an elf or orc, they will attempt to call them into a trap.
