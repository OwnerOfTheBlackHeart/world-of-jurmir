<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	A wolf made of a strange black metal, with a skeletal body with vine-like metal muscle. Its skeleton and head are scarily similar to
	an actual wolf's.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
	Bjork 2s prefer to attack from around 30 feet away, often darting away into cover if its initial attack proves ineffective. It may also
	seek to isolate and eliminate targets.
