<p>
    Kaitlyn's tentacle-tail is treated as being of a size category larger than her for the sake of reach and damage, and always adds 1&#189; strength to it's
    damage.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Weapon Alignment:</i>
    Kaitlyn’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons she wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the 
    purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Energy Drain (Su):</i>
    Kaitlyn drains energy from a mortal it lures into some act of passion, or by simply planting a kiss on the victim. 
    If the target is not willing to be kissed, Kaitlyn must start a grapple, which provokes an attack of opportunity. 
    Kaitlyn’s kiss or embrace bestows one negative level. The kiss also has the effect of a suggestion spell, asking 
    the victim to accept another kiss from Kaitlyn. The victim must succeed on a DC 23 Will save to negate the effect 
    of the suggestion. The DC is 23 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. These save DCs are Charisma-based.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Spell-like abilities:</i>
    At will—charm monster (DC 22), detect good, detect thoughts (DC 20), ethereal jaunt (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), 
    suggestion (DC 21), greater teleport (self plus 50 pounds of objects only). Caster level 16th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Summon Grick (Sp):</i>
    Once per day Kaitlyn can attempt to summon 1d4+1 gricks with a 50% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of 
    a 4th-level spell.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Change Shape (Su):</i>
    Kaitlyn can assume the form of any Small or Medium humanoid.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Tongues (Su):</i>
    Kaitlyn has a permanent tongues ability (as the spell, caster level 12th). Kaitlyn usually uses verbal communication 
    with mortals.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Princess’s Gifts (Su):</i>
    Kaitlyn can grant willing humans a gift of power, granting +4 morale bonus to charisma and the ability to use Alter Self,
    as Kaitlyn, 3 times per day. Those granted her gifts can also add her charisma to all weapon attacks
    and damage rolls for 1 round a number of times per day equal to 3 + constitution modifier. So long as the recipient of the gift
    is on the same plane as Kaitlyn, they can communicate telepathically.
</p>
<p>
    A human accepting the gifts of Kaitlyn may at any time be compelled by Kaitlyn. This is as per the suggestion
    spell, except at any distance and on any plane and may be obviously harmful or unreasonable. The DC (23) for this effect is charisma
    based. Reasonable suggestions increase the DC by 1 or 2, while unreasonable suggestions decrease the DC by 1 to 5. Once compelled,
    the human cannot be compelled again for 6 hours and may not be given the same compel for 24 hours.
</p>
<p>
    A half-human, or human blooded like a tiefling, can also gain Princess's Gifts, however they only gain 1 use of Alter Self per
    day and all bonuses gained by the gift are halved. The half-human also gains a +5 bonus to resist the red princess's suggestions.
</p>
<p>
    Kaitlyn can maintain a number of gifts equal to her charisma modifier, ignoring temporary changes to charisma. At any
    time the human can refuse the gift or Kaitlyn can take it back.

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    In her true form, Kaitlyn is a 7' 7" tall "human" woman with F (DDD) cup titties (which are roughly the same proportions of her original titties),
    ruddy skin, slightly glowing red eyes, ass length strawberry blonde hair, an abnormally long and flexible torso, a 7 foot long, prehensile, tentacle-like
    tail with a jagged blade on the end of it, and a pair of bat-like wings covered in occasional spots of white scales. Starting from the back of her head,
    below her hair, Kaitlyn has thick, strong white scales that run down along her back and down her tail, though the scales don't appear on her arms or legs.
</p>
<p>
    Normally, when Kaitlyn is in her true form, she is naked, save for a cornstalk necklace with a wooden carving of a rabbit, a wooden carving of a grick,
    and her simple, wooden symbol of the <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button>. If she is planning on revealing her true form in a
    setting where not wearing clothes would be a determent to her, Kaitlyn will wear a crimson red, silk cloak/robe that lazily drapes over her body and only
    barely covers her. She walks with a seductive strut.
</p>
<p>
    As of yet, Kaitlyn's congregation isn't large enough to grant her bodyguards, not that she needs them, or spies.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
    While Kaitlyn is more combat capable than most red princesses, she still prefers to avoid combat. If she can, she'll use her enemies against each other, but
    if she can't, Kaitlyn will try to place a wall of bodies between her and her opponents, firing away with her flaming crossbow. If it's safe to do, Kaitlyn will
    stand behind her meat wall and attack with both her crossbow and her tail, though Kaitlyn considers her claws her last resort.
