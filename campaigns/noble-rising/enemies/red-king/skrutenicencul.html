    <h2 id="gm-notes">GM Notes</h2>
    <p>
        Skrutenicencul has heard of an artifact known as the Third Piton of Sithrak, a size-changing piton that acts as a +3 holy cold iron shortspear that can bind an outsider
        to the current plane, which prevents the corpse from breaking down and returning to its home plane. The advantage of this, to Skrutenicencul, is that
        it would allow him to consume the flesh of a deceased outsider and, hopefully, absorb some of its power. Skrutenicencul is looking for someone who can bring him the
        corpses of an angel and a balor, and believes that the Third Piton of Sithrak is how such a corpse could be brought to him.

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Skrutenicencul is a 13' 8" long, monstrous grick with scales the color of dirty snow with a underbelly the color of freshly fallen snow, a pair of white bat-like wings
    that connect to his "torso" region with a single, large claw on each and a wingspan of 23 feet, and an oversized, toothed beak. Skrutenicencul's body, tentacles and 
    wing "arms" possess rippling muscle. A slight chill to the air hangs around Skrutenicencul.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
    Skrutenicencul prefers to catch his enemy off guard and attack quickly, either dropping in from above or striking from a snow bank, however, Skrutenicencul is
    intelligent and perfectly happy to use other tactics in order to fight his opponents. Skrutenicencul will usually pounce on anything that looks like casters or archers
    before attacking melee focused enemies. If faced with invisible opponents, Skrutenicencul tries to use his scent ability to track them and his breath weapon to
    cover the square they are in, or if he can't detect them, Skrutenicencul will simply fly up, either hovering in place to kick up debris or fly away.
</p>
<p>
    Skrutenicencul would rather retreat and lick his wounds than die in combat. As such, if he is bloodied and lacks a clear advantage, he will fly away.
