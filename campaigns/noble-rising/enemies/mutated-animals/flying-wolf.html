<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	This wolf has longer legs than a normal wolf, but its most distinguishing feature is the large pair of wings
	growing from its shoulders.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
	A favorite tactic is to send a few individuals against the foeâ€™s front while the rest of the pack circles and 
	attacks from the flanks or rear.
