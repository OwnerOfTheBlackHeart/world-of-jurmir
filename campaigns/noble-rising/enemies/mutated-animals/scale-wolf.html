<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	This creature has the body and eyes of a wolf, but it has short, bristly fur that fails to hide the armor like
	scales that coat this wolf's body. The chest and legs of this wolf are slightly large than a normal wolf's.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
	A favorite tactic is to send a few individuals against the foe’s front while the rest of the pack circles and 
	attacks from the flanks or rear.
