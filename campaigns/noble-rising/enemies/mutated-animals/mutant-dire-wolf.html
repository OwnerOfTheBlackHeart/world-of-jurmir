<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
	This immense gray wolf seems as big as a horse. It has fiery eyes and a thick coat of black fur. It is about 9 feet long
	and 850 pounds.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
	Mutated dire wolves are more aggressive than normal dire wolves and far more combative. They start a fight by charging against
	the smallest creature on the battlefield and attacking with their bite. Mutated dire wolves have no sense of self preservation
	in combat and ignore damage.
