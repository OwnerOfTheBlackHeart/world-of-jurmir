<p><b>*</b> Common is available only to mutated kobolds with 12, or higher, intelligence.</p>

<p>
    Mutated kobolds with the brute strain treat their bone blades as 2 handed weapons for determine bonuses to damage from strength and power attack.
</p>

<p>
    Mutated kobolds count as both monstrous humanoids and dragons for the sake of spells and effects. The stalker strain gains 6 + int skill points per level,

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Mutated kobolds, regardless of strain, all have the typical dark rusty brown to rusty black scales, glowing red eyes, double kneed legs, and crocodile like heads,
    as well as occasional, cancer-like iridescent scales, long tails ending in a viscous stinger, misaligned teeth that grow in rows like sharks and bone blades that 
    extend from their forearms. 
</p>
<p>
    The bone blades don't interfere with the mutated kobold's ability to use tools, though few have the training to use such effectively. Mutated kobolds have the 
    ability to use simple weapons, but view their natural weapons as being more effective. Unlike weapons, mutated kobolds lack the knowledge and training to use
    tools and armor effectively, and, if brought to a communicable state, are apprehensive to use tools, weapons and armor. 
    <ap-auth-container permissions="gm noble-full mutated-kobolds-tools" inline>
        Mutated kobolds are apprehensive about tools and armor because those who drive them out of normal kobold society utilize them and they fear that if they
        begin using tools and armor, they will grow weak and lose their own will.
    </ap-auth-container>
</p>
<p>
    The kobolds afflicted with the stalker strain stand 2 to 2½ feet tall and weigh 40 to 60 pounds. They tend to be skinnier and denser than normal kobolds,
    with pads on the bottoms of their feet that let them move more quietly then their density would suggest.
</p>
<p>
    The kobolds afflicted with the attuned strain stand 4 to 5 feet tall and weigh 130 to 170 pounds. They have builds between a human and a dwarf and often
    decorate themselves with small, glowing tattoos that they use instinctual rituals to create.
</p>
<p>
    The kobolds afflicted with the brute strain stand 8½ to 10 feet tall and weigh 600 to 800 pounds. They have builds like castle walls, sturdy and stout, with
    surprising speed. Brute strains also posses serrated bone blades and a surprising amount of presence.
</p>
<p>
    Mutated kobolds are hated and feared by the world that birthed them, and they return the sentiment. Those who have survived to adulthood either have mental
    scars from their, inevitably harrowing, escape or were born into a clan and taught to hate everything: Themselves, the world that abandoned them, whatever
    force created them and everything but the clan.
</p>
<p>
    Clans of mutated kobolds vary wildly, from a few survivors incapable of breeding with each other to established clans with massive breeding orgies to well
    organized clans that raid kobold dens and drag their victims back to throw in massive vats of mutagen. However, one thing that is consistent is that the
    biggest and strongest mutated kobold rules, with the smartest and sneakiest brought into their employ as advisors and agents, often forming "noble courts"
    in their unfurnished caves.
</p>
<p>
    Mutated kobolds are aware that there is a god that calls to them, but they ignore their god out of sheer spite, believing that any god who would allow them to
    be put through the various trials inherent to surviving as a mutant kobold is unworthy of so much as recognition. This is the same excuse they use for dismissing
    every god.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
    While mutated kobolds aren't particularly intelligent, they are clever and will use group tactics and the environment to their advantage, attacking from ambushes
    and drawing enemies into choke points, utilizing flanking manuevers, and abusing the fact that they operate the same in complete darkness as they do in bright
    daylight. Unlike normal kobolds, mutated kobolds never willingly use traps as they often forget where they are placed and get trapped in the trap themselves.
</p>
<p>
    While mutated kobolds are aware of the fact they have poisonous stingers on their tales, this fact often escapes their minds, up until they are in the middle of
    a fight and attacking with everything they have.
</p>
<p>
    Stalker strains never attack alone and with never willingly enter a violent engagement without at least one other ally. Stalkers prefer to quietly follow their
    targets until they see a good opportunity to strike, using the time following them to determine the capabilities of their foes. Compared to the other mutated
    kobold strains, the stalker is the most sadistic, thoroughly enjoying any opportunity they can to slowly kill a helpless opponent.
</p>
<p>
    Attuned strains are more confident and brave than their stalker brethren, in both their physical and magical abilities. If fought in melee, attuned will rely
    on their physical abilities. If given time to prepare, attuned like to cast their buffing spells (such as Bull's Strength and Fire Shield), then charge a 
    Shocking Grasp and charge in with the spell the next turn. They are also liable to retreat and heal if the need and opportunity presents itself. If there are
    other mutated kobolds around, attuned are perfectly content to buff their allies and act as artillery with Fireball, Sound Burst and Magic Missile. While attuned
    take great joy in the fight and in killing their foes, they have no interest in foes that can't fight back and leave bodies where they lay.
</p>
<p>
    Brute strains are considered the most confident and fearless of the mutated kobolds, charging the most dangerous looking foes with reckless abandon. The reality
    is that brutes are incredibly skittish and attack anything they perceive as a threat like a cornered animal. They prefer to get the opening blows on an opponent,
    hoping to drive off their foes before they can cause serious damage. During a fight, if a brute notices an enemy fleeing, they will let them unless the brute
    believes the foes to be retreating to ready another attack or to be dangerous to allow to flee. This perception of their foes' intent is clouded by their haze of fear
    and the stress of the fight, giving them roughly a 50/50 chance they'll chase down a fleeing character. After every battle, brutes make a point of eating the
    bravest opponent in the hopes they will gain some of that courage.
</p>
<p>
    When forming mixed strain groups, an attuned typically handles coordinating and strategizing the group. The first part of any multi-strain battle plan is whether
    to have the brutes draw the enemy in or have them charge the enemy. After this opening assault begins, the attuned hang back and use their magic to benefit their
    allies and harass their enemies, while the stalkers swarm lone enemies and get behind those distracted by brutes. If the terrain does not benefit this basic plan,
    the attuned in charge will try to organize their battle group to use the terrain to their best advantage. A common mistake among the attuned is to over-consider
    the terrain and disregard the capabilities of their enemies, outside of movement and position.
</p>
