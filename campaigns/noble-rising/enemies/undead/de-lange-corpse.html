<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Standing at a hair under 6' tall, the corpse of King Thys De Lange gives little evidence as to what the king looked like in life, except for the obvious signs
    of a healthy diet. The half-rotted zombie is clad in a crude, by modern standards, steel breastplate that's been hastily thrown over his vibrant purple court
    clothes. The corpse wields a ceremonial ranseur with a flame that never burns out.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
    Lacking any sense of tactics, the corpse of King Thys De Lange charges upon seeing living creatures, attacking with its ranseur whenever it can, otherwise slamming
    its opponents.
