<p>
	<i class="power">False Appearance (Su):</i> A pseudo reaper appears as a humanoid skeleton within a black cloak made of shadows with a brutal
	looking farm scythe. Should a creature attack, or be attacked by, a pseudo reaper in melee combat they must make a DC 18 will save. If the
	creature fails, they take 1 wisdom damage as the visage of death takes its tole. If the creature passes, they realize that the pseudo reaper
	is just a skeleton and that the weapon of the pseudo reaper is actually a quarterstaff made of stone and are immune to that specific pseudo
	reaper's False Appearance for 24 hours.
</p>
<p>
	This is a mind altering fear effect. The save DC for False Appearance is charisma based.
</p>

<p>
	<i class="power">Fear Aura (Su):</i> As a free action, once per round, a pseudo reaper can project a supernatural fear of death. Every enemy within
	30 feet must make a DC 18 will save. On a failure, the creature is panicked for 1d4 rounds and, if the creature is 4 HD or less, the creature is
	paralyzed, in fear, for 1 round before becoming panicked. On a success, the creature is immune to that specific pseudo reaper's Fear Aura for
	24 hours.
</p>
<p>
	Creatures that have are immune to the pseudo reaper's False Appearance are immune to this ability. The save DC for Fear Aura is charisma based.
</p>

<p>
	<i class="power">Touch of Death (Su):</i> A pseudo reaper's natural attacks, and any melee weapons it wields, deal an additional +1d6 cold damage.
</p>

<p>
	<i class="power">Spellcasting:</i> A pseudo reaper casts as a sorcerer of 8th level.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	In its true form, a pseudo reaper is merely a skeleton with a small bag of focuses and a stone quarterstaff. However, to those who have
	not yet seen through the pseudo reaper's guise instead see a white or black robe-like figure with a nasty scythe and skeletons flowing
	beneath it.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
	Pseudo reapers like to confuse and harass their targets, deploying summons and buffing allies while staying out of the strike range of
	enemies. If they are forced to melee, pseudo reapers will use Death Armor on themselves to punish enemies that attack them while utilizing
	their Fear Aura and False Appearance to halt and weaken their foes.
