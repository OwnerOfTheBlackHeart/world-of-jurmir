<p>
    <i class="power">Blood Drain (Ex):</i> A vampire can suck blood from a living victim with its fangs by making a successful grapple check. If it pins the foe, 
    it drains blood, dealing 1d4 points of Constitution drain each round the pin is maintained. On each such successful attack, the vampire gains 5 temporary hit points.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Children of the Night  (Su):</i> Vampires command the lesser creatures of the world and once per day can call forth 1d6+1 rat swarms, 1d4+1 bat swarms, 
    or a pack of 3d6 wolves as a standard action. (If the base creature is not terrestrial, this power might summon other creatures of similar power.) These creatures 
    arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve the vampire for up to 1 hour.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Dominate (Su):</i> A vampire can crush an opponent’s will just by looking onto his or her eyes. This is similar to a gaze attack, except that the 
    vampire must use a standard action, and those merely looking at it are not affected. Anyone the vampire targets must succeed on a Will save or fall instantly under 
    the vampire’s influence as though by a dominate person spell (caster level 12th). The ability has a range of 30 feet.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Create Spawn (Su):</i> A humanoid or monstrous humanoid slain by a vampire’s energy drain rises as a vampire spawn 1d4 days after burial.
</p>
<p>
    If the vampire instead drains the victim’s Constitution to 0 or lower, the victim returns as a spawn if it had 4 or less HD and as a vampire if it had 5 or more HD. In 
    either case, the new vampire or spawn is under the command of the vampire that created it and remains enslaved until its master’s destruction. At any given time a 
    vampire may have enslaved spawn totaling no more than twice its own Hit Dice; any spawn it creates that would exceed this limit are created as free-willed vampires or 
    vampire spawn. A vampire that is enslaved may create and enslave spawn of its own, so a master vampire can control a number of lesser vampires in this fashion. A vampire 
    may voluntarily free an enslaved spawn in order to enslave a new spawn, but once freed, a vampire or vampire spawn cannot be enslaved again.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Energy Drain (Su):</i> Living creatures hit by a vampire’s slam attack (or any other natural weapon the vampire might possess) gain two negative levels. 
    For each negative level bestowed, the vampire gains 5 temporary hit points. A vampire can use its energy drain ability once per round.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Alternate Form (Su):</i> A vampire can assume the shape of a bat, dire bat, wolf, or dire wolf as a standard action. While in its alternate form, the vampire 
    loses its natural slam attack and dominate ability, but it gains the natural weapons and extraordinary special attacks of its new form. It can remain in that form until it 
    assumes another or until the next sunrise. (If the base creature is not terrestrial, this power might allow other forms.)
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Damage Reduction (Su):</i> A vampire has damage reduction 10/silver and magic. A vampire’s natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of 
    overcoming damage reduction.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Fast Healing (Ex):</i> A vampire heals 5 points of damage each round so long as it has at least 1 hit point. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, it 
    automatically assumes gaseous form and attempts to escape. It must reach its coffin home within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed. (It can travel up to nine miles in 2 hours.) 
    Any additional damage dealt to a vampire forced into gaseous form has no effect. Once at rest in its coffin, a vampire is helpless. It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then 
    is no longer helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit points per round.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Gaseous Form (Su):</i> As a standard action, a vampire can assume gaseous form at will as the spell (caster level 5th), but it can remain gaseous indefinitely 
    and has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Spider Climb (Ex):</i> A vampire can climb sheer surfaces as though with a spider climb spell.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Turn Resistance (Ex):</i> A vampire has +4 turn resistance.

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
	An gaunt elf with abnormally long fangs and an unnatural grace lies within a set of black robes with a long, hooded cloak and a belt of small pouches.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
    A vampire wizard prefers to avoid getting close to their enemies, slinging ranged spells and attacking with their bow until they have disabled all their
    enemies or been caught in melee. If they manage to paralyze an enemy, the vampire wizard will immediately try to drain their blood.
