<p>
	<i class="power">Malevolence (Su):</i> Once per round, an ethereal ghost can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar 
    to a magic jar spell (caster level 10th or the ghost’s Hit Dice, whichever is higher), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this ability, 
    the ghost must be manifested and it must try move into the target’s space; moving into the target’s space to use the malevolence ability does not provoke 
    attacks of opportunity. The target can resist the attack with a successful Will save (DC 17). A creature that successfully saves is 
    immune to that same ghost’s malevolence for 24 hours, and the ghost cannot enter the target’s space. If the save fails, the ghost vanishes into the target’s body.
</p>

<p>
	<i class="power">Manifestation (Su):</i> Every ghost has this ability. A ghost dwells on the Ethereal Plane and, as an ethereal creature, it cannot affect or be 
    affected by anything in the material world. When a ghost manifests, it partly enters the Material Plane and becomes visible but incorporeal on the Material Plane. 
    A manifested ghost can be harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, or spells, with a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal source. 
    A manifested ghost can pass through solid objects at will, and its own attacks pass through armor. A manifested ghost always moves silently. A manifested ghost 
    can strike with its touch attack or with a ghost touch weapon (see Ghostly Equipment, below). A manifested ghost remains partially on the Ethereal Plane, where 
    is it not incorporeal. A manifested ghost can be attacked by opponents on either the Material Plane or the Ethereal Plane. The ghost’s incorporeality helps 
    protect it from foes on the Material Plane, but not from foes on the Ethereal Plane.
</p>
<p>
	When a spellcasting ghost is not manifested and is on the Ethereal Plane, its spells cannot affect targets on the Material Plane, but they work normally against 
    ethereal targets. When a spellcasting ghost manifests, its spells continue to affect ethereal targets and can affect targets on the Material Plane normally unless 
    the spells rely on touch. A manifested ghost’s touch spells don’t work on nonethereal targets.
</p>
<p>
    A ghost has two home planes, the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. It is not considered extraplanar when on either of these planes.
</p>

<p>
	<i class="power">Rejuvenation (Su):</i> In most cases, it’s difficult to destroy a ghost through simple combat: The "destroyed" spirit will often restore itself 
    in 2d4 days. Even the most powerful spells are usually only temporary solutions. A ghost that would otherwise be destroyed returns to its old haunts with a 
    successful level check (1d20 + ghost’s HD) against DC 16. As a rule, the only way to get rid of a ghost for sure is to determine the reason for its existence 
    and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and may require a good deal of research.
