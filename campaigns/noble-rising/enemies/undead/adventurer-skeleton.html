<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
	Made from the bodies of those who tried to fight their way to the River Cain, the adventurer's skeleton is a skeleton draped in suit of full plate armor
    that has been rebound with leather made from its own body. The warhammer and longbow of the skeleton remain in excellent condition.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
	Adventurer's skeletons fight without tactics or forethought, charging the nearest enemy and striking at them with their warhammers. They will only use their
    bows if ordered to by an intelligent undead, or other force that controls them.
