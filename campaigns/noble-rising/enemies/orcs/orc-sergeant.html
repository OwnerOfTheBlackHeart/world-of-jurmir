<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	This gray skinned humanoid with coarse, black hair has a stooped posture, low forehead, and a piglike face, with prominent lower canines
	that resemble tusks and lupine ears. It stands at a little over 6 feet tall with rippling muscles and a dirty, unkempt chainshirt with an 
	equally poorly kept falchion.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
	Orcs are proficient with all simple weapons, preferring those that cause the most damage in the least time. Many orcs who take up
	the warrior or fighter class also gain proficiency with the falchion or the greataxe as a martial weapon. They enjoy attacking from 
	concealment and setting ambushes, and they obey the rules of war (such as honoring a truce) only as long as it is convenient for them.
</p>
<p>
	Orc sergeants will attempt to rally their orcs around them to swarm the easiest enemies first, though the sergeant will happily sacrifice
	their troops in order to save their own necks. Orc sergeants like to steal kills from their subordinates.
