<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
	This gray skinned humanoid with coarse, black hair has a stooped posture, low forehead, and a piglike face, with prominent lower canines
	that resemble tusks and lupine ears. It stands at a little over 6 feet tall with rippling muscles and a suit of dirty, unkempt half-plate
	armor with a surprisingly clean greataxe.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
	Orcs are proficient with all simple weapons, preferring those that cause the most damage in the least time. Many orcs who take up
	the warrior or fighter class also gain proficiency with the falchion or the greataxe as a martial weapon. They enjoy attacking from 
	concealment and setting ambushes, and they obey the rules of war (such as honoring a truce) only as long as it is convenient for them.
</p>
<p>
	Orc captains rule through fear and work to keep their subordinates as afraid of them as possible. As with all orc leadership, orc
	captains happily sacrifice subordinates if it benefits them.
