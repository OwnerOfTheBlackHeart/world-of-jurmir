<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	Nen warriors stand between 8 and 12 feet and weight between 800 and 1,200 pound, the typical nen warrior resembles a cockroach
	standing on its back pair of legs. All nen extremities have 3 digits (2 fingers and a thumb for hands, 2 forward toes and 1 backward 
	toe for feet) and are typically thick and sturdy. Nen exoskeletons are both thick and durable, allowing the nen to shrug off attacks 
	as if they were wearing full body armor and survive in otherwise hostile conditions (such as deserts).
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
	Nen warriors are highly aggressive and go after the largest target in their sight. They usually prefer to carry as large of weapons as they
	can get their claws on. When they don't have a weapon, they will gladly rip someone apart with their claws.
</p>
<p>
	When nen warriors are away from their hives, they may be more calm or more aggressive than normal.
