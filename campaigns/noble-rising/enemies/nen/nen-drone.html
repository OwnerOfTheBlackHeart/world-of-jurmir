<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Nen drones stand between 4 and 6 feet tall, resembling a long, thin cockroach standing on its back pair of legs. All nen extremities 
    have 3 digits (2 fingers and a thumb for hands, 2 forward toes and 1 backward toe for feet) and are typically thick and sturdy. Nen 
    exoskeletons are both thick and durable, allowing the nen to shrug off attacks as if they were wearing armor and survive in 
    otherwise hostile conditions (such as deserts).
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
    Nen drones are highly aggressive when defending their hive, using swarm tactics when they can and coordinating with any nen warriors
    in the area to try and make their enemies even easier prey. Nen drones also like to use ambushes, where they cling to the ceiling and
    wait for nearby drones or warriors to be disturbed before attacking as a single mass. Nen drones don't go into melee unless it is
    absolutely necessary or all their enemies are locked down and they can surround the enemy(ies) with too many nen to effectively fight.
</p>
<p>
    Nen drones away from their hives (or otherwise alone) avoid fighting altogether and may even attempt to work out diplomatic solutions.
    However, nen drones happily work with nen warriors and other drones to form raiding parties that are far less likely to surrender.
