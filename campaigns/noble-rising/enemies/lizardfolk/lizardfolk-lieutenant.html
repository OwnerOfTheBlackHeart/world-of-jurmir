<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
	This lizardfolk carries a shield made from it's previous kills and a simple, well worn stone club, though it's body is covered in the scars of prior conflicts.
    As it spots new prey, the lizardfolk licks it's lips hungrily.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
	Lizardfolk lieutenants are simple combatants, preferring to use their stronger builds get the strongest foes to focus them while any lizardfolk they
    command aid them, either by killing off weaker foes or by attacking their foe.
