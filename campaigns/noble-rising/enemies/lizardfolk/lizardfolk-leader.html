<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
	This lizardfolk is covered in the hides of prior kills, which have been poorly sewn together into makeshift armor, while carrying the biggest club in
    the room. Upon seeing foes, this lizardfolk's lips pull back to reveal it's sharp teeth, just as ready as its club to add a new skin to its collection.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
	Lizardfolk leaders are simple combatants, preferring to use their stronger builds get the strongest foes to focus them while any lizardfolk they
    command aid them, either by killing off weaker foes or by attacking their foe.
