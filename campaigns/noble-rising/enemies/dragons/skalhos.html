    <i class="power">Breath Weapon (Su):</i> A black dragon has one type of breath weapon, a line of corrosive (acid) gas.
</p>
<p>
    <i class="power">Water Breathing (Ex):</i> A black dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its 
    breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged.
</p>
<p>
    <i class="power">Corrupt Water (Sp):</i> Once per day an adult or older black dragon can stagnate 10 cubic feet of water, 
    making it become still, foul, and unable to support animal life. The ability spoils liquids containing water. Magic items 
    (such as potions) and items in a creature’s possession must succeed on a Will save (DC equal to that of the dragon’s frightful 
    presence) or become fouled. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell. Its range is equal to that of the dragon’s frightful presence.

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    <b><i> EVERYTHING BELOW THIS POINT IS CURRENTLY PLACEHOLDER</i></b>
</p>
<p>
    Skalhos is a black dragon who stands at about 7 feet at the should, when walking, and roughly 32 feet from nose to tail. She is 
    a normal black dragon in appearance, with a skull-like face framed by horns. Skalhos's wings are heavily scared.
</p>
<p>
	While Skalhos moves almost silently and carefully, she does so without any form of grace.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
    Skalhos prefers to start any fight hidden within shallow waters, striking the enemy from behind, using either her breath weapon or a volley
    of natural attacks, whichever can do the most damage in the opening assault. After the initial ambush, Skalhos will attempt to draw the enemy
    deeper into any number of prepared ambushes or traps, designed to draw out the suffering of the enemies for as long as possible.
