<p>
    <i class="power">Improved Grab (Ex):</i> To use this ability, a wyvern must hit with its talons. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action 
    without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and stings.
</p>
<p>
    <i class="power">Poison (Ex):</i> Injury, Fortitude DC 27, initial and secondary damage 2d6 Con. The save DC is Constitution-based.
</p>
<p>
    <i class="power">Fireball (Ex):</i> Rathian have a special gland of a flammable, napalm-like fluid which can be expelled through the rathian's mouth
    as a ball of flame. As a standard action, a rathian can lob a ball of this flammable fluid up to 30 feet, where it lands and explodes into a 5' radius
    area of fire, dealing a number of d6s of fire damage equal to the rathian's hit dice to those in the radius that fail a DC 25 Reflex save, or take half
    damage if they succeeded. A rathian requires 2d4 turns to recover enough of this fluid to use this ability again. The save DC is Constitution-based.

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Typically 57 feet in length and 19 feet at the hip, this wyvern's scaled hide is a dull, muted green while her lower mandible features a long, protruding 
    chin spike. Her upper back and wingtips are covered in a moss-like fur while her clubbed tail has sharp and highly poisonous needles.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
	While rathians can fly, their mass makes it energy intensive to maintain powered flight. As such, rathians prefer to fight on the ground, where their
    strong legs can propel them after their foes, reserving flight for short, near ground bursts of speed and long range gliding. A rathian may also hover
    for 1d4 rounds, restricting them to only tail attacks and fireballs, but rendering them immune to non-reach melee weapons. While hovering, rathians
    will use their wingover manuever to face their opponents, which may be followed up with a fireball or a tail attack.
</p>
<p>
    If hunting, rather than defending their nest, rathians are liable to use their snatch feat to grab a medium, or smaller, creature and carry them to
    the rathian's nest, where they will be eaten.
</p>
<p>
    When a rathian's nest is empty of eggs or chicks, she will have no hesitation to flee should an enemy overpower her, but if eggs or chicks are present
    in a rathian's nest, she will fight to the bitter end to defend them.
