<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Wearing a simple suit of chainmail, this catfolk woman would blend in with any army or party of slayers.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
    Sisters rarely fight alone, instead fighting with the tactics of the group they are joining with. If forced to fight on their own, they will do so only if they
    believe that they have a good chance of winning. The moment that they believe they are losing, a sister will run, retreat, or if they believe it will be to their
    benefit, surrender.
