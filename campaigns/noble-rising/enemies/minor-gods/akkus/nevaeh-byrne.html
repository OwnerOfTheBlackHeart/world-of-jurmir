<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Nevaeh is a 5' 3" tall human woman with an athletic build, D cup titties, back length red hair (which goes almost to her elbows), blue eyes, pale to 
    tanned skin (depending on the season), and an intense gaze. Nevaeh typically wears a suit of mithral chainmail with the leather dyed red, a brown 
    leather underskirt and her well made longsword resting in its sheath on her left hip. 
</p>
<p>
    When meeting with nobles, and the like, Nevaeh wears a finely woven, bright orange dress with a mink fur shawl and rose gold jewelry.
</p>
<p>
    If she is in a town where wearing armor would be inappropriate, Nevaeh wears a tight, green-black, cotton shirt, a brown wool skirt, a brown, leather vest,
    and a pair of leather boots with a black-green leather hooded-cloak.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
    While Nevaeh is capable of fighting an opponent head on, she prefers not to. Instead, Nevaeh likes to catch opponents off guard, when possible, but
    is more than happy to settle for any other position that grants her sneak attack. As such, Nevaeh is hesitant to go into a fight alone, preferring
    to have at least 2 other warriors who she can flank with.
</p>
<p>
    If forced into a fight where she can't engage in melee with sneak attacks, Nevaeh will keep her distance and bombard her opponent with arrows for
    as long as she can.
</p>

<h2 id="history-and-motivation">History and Motivation</h2>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm camilia-history noble-full">
    <p>
        Born the daughter of bandits that preyed exclusively on the wealthy, Nevaeh grew up on the move, constantly running from one set of guards
        to the next set of assassins. While this was simply life to the young Nevaeh, she slowly realized who her parents truly were as she grew older,
        and she began to grow resentful of their greed and how it never seemed to bring her anything but trouble. Still, Nevaeh saw the usefulness
        of the skills her parents held and what they could do for her.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nevaeh's spite of her parents came to a head when they took her out on her first raid. She had been told to use her beauty to convince a wealthy
        merchant to hire her on as a caravan guard, then let her parents in during her shift to steal what they could take and disappear into the night.
        Nevaeh had no problem convincing the merchant to hire her, for a fair bit more than she was worth, and travelled with the caravan for 2 days.
        During her time with the caravan, Nevaeh found herself enjoying the structure and peace of the job, as well as her own pay. When her parents finally
        did come in the night, rather than grabbing what she could and running off with them, Nevaeh sounded the alarm, killing her mother while her
        mother was frozen in shock and let her father die to a hail of arrows.
    </p>
    <p>
        After the caravan job, Nevaeh accepted her pay and decided to journey for a short while, looking to understand the world her parents had hid from
        her. Once she had a year's travel under her belt, Nevaeh decided to join the Queen's Army, though she only stayed one term.
    </p>
    <p>
        After her time with the Queen's Army, Nevaeh found herself desiring a strange mix of freedom and structure, a place where she could advance by
        her own merit, at her own pace, but with a clear sense of purpose and chain of command. She search for a while, eventually coming upon a small
        group of <ap-link-button linkName="noble-fallenfeather-sisterhood">Fallenfeather</ap-link-button> sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
        After a night of drinking with the sisters, Nevaeh was offered a chance to help them clear out a cult, for an equal share of the loot, which
        she graciously accepted. The raid went successfully, and Nevaeh found herself being given several thinly veiled tests. With each completed
        test, Nevaeh learned more and more about the <ap-link-button linkName="noble-fallenfeather-sisterhood">Sisterhood</ap-link-button>, until her
        final test was given: To stand before <ap-link-button linkName="noble-akkus">Akkus</ap-link-button> and be judged.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nevaeh found <ap-link-button linkName="noble-akkus">Akkus</ap-link-button> and the 
        <ap-link-button linkName="noble-fallenfeather-sisterhood">Fallenfeather Sisterhood</ap-link-button> offered the curious mix of freedom and structure
        that Nevaeh desired and, without hesitation, joined the <ap-link-button linkName="noble-fallenfeather-sisterhood">Fallenfeather Sisterhood</ap-link-button>
        when <ap-link-button linkName="noble-akkus">Akkus</ap-link-button> found her worthy.
