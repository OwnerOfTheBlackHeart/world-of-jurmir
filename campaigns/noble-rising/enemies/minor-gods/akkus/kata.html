<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Typically armed only with a few sets of clothes, a bag of coins, and a mission, katas serve as the spies and knowledge seekers of the
    <ap-link-button linkName="noble-fallenfeather-sisterhood">Fallenfeather Sisterhood</ap-link-button>. While katas occasionally put on their war gear, they only
    do so because they are working with a <ap-link-button linkName="noble-fallenfeather-fury">fury</ap-link-button> to clear out a "noisy" cult or because the
    appearance will grant them some form of advantage.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
    Kata's only fight when they have some form of "tank" to draw attention away from them. Once the "tank" has began drawing fire, the kata(s) will surround a single
    opponent and begin unleashing as many sneak attacks as they can.
