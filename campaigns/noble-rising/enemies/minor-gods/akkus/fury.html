<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    One of the assassins of the <ap-link-button linkName="noble-fallenfeather-sisterhood">Fallenfeather Sisterhood</ap-link-button>, this catfolk wears an enchanted
    set of studded leather armor, carrying a rapier, hatchet and a longbow. A fury only appears alone when they are already hunting a target, otherwise preferring to work with
    <ap-link-button linkName="noble-fallenfeather-kata">katas</ap-link-button> to find their targets in the first place.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
    Furies are as confident as they are careful. Most enemies of <ap-link-button linkName="noble-akkus">Akkus</ap-link-button> never see or hear the fury that struck them
    down. While furies are more than comfortable using their bow, they are well aware that they are far stronger with their rapier and handaxe and will try to force their
    enemies to engage them in melee, should stealth fail.
</p>
<p>
    Furies do not normally work in teams. Instead, if the problem is bigger than a single fury can handle, they will try to recruit a 
    <ap-link-button linkName="noble-fallenfeather-kata">kata</ap-link-button> to help them build up a more appropriate force. If a target is big enough, a fury may even
    call in a <ap-link-button linkName="noble-fallenfeather-kide">kide</ap-link-button> and a <ap-link-button linkName="noble-fallenfeather-fone">fone</ap-link-button>.
</p>
<p>
    Most furies don't keep animal companions, so as to avoid drawing attention to their skill set.
