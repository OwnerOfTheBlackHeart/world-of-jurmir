<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    This irritable looking half-orc woman wields a finely made mithral breast plate, an executioners sword she wields in a single hand and an oversized longbow.
    She sizes up her targets for only a moment before springing into action.
</p>
<p>
    Kides are rare for those outside the <ap-link-button linkName="noble-fallenfeather-sisterhood">Fallenfeather Sisterhood</ap-link-button>, as their lack of etiquette
    and sociability makes them hard to keep from drawing attention. Instead, kides normally operate as guards for the
    <ap-link-button linkName="noble-fallenfeather-sisterhood">Fallenfeather Sisterhood</ap-link-button> and even <ap-link-button linkName="noble-akkus">Akkus</ap-link-button>
    herself, though other branches of the <ap-link-button linkName="noble-fallenfeather-sisterhood">Fallenfeather Sisterhood</ap-link-button> can call upon kides
    if they find something that warrants their attention.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
    The most aggressive combatants that the <ap-link-button linkName="noble-fallenfeather-sisterhood">Fallenfeather Sisterhood</ap-link-button> brings can bring to bear,
    kides happily draw attention from other combatants with their skill, oversized weapons and magic. When they can, kides position themselves so that they can flank with
    any of their allies, offering the ability for all parties involved to use their sneak attack. Kides only use their longbows when melee isn't an option.
</p>
<p>
    Unlike other branches of the <ap-link-button linkName="noble-fallenfeather-sisterhood">Fallenfeather Sisterhood</ap-link-button>, kides don't care for glory or rank,
    instead caring about the safety of their sisters and <ap-link-button linkName="noble-akkus">Akkus</ap-link-button>. This means that kides are far more willing to
    work with others of their own branch, bringing formations of well trained warriors down upon their foes.
