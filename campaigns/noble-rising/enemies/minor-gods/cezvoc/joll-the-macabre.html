    <li>
        Joll travels frequently, using his mastery of manipulating people into liking him to create new

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Joll is a 6' 3" tall, male orc with shaggy, black hair, deep green skin, red eyes and a light build. While Joll normally wears
    his plain full plate armor when traveling, while working a settlement to form a new cult, he will either wear his
    <ap-link-button linkName="noble-cezvoc">Cezvoc</ap-link-button> worship robes or whatever clothes the locals have adorned him with.
</p>

<h2 id="history-and-motivation">History and Motivation</h2>
<p>
    Joll started life as one of the tribal raiding orcs scatter throughout the land; However, the recent work to "civilize" wild orcs
    caused Joll's clan to be captured and sent to the mines. Weakened by a lack of food, water and sleep, and held in place by chains,
    Joll was visited in his dreams by <ap-link-button linkName="noble-cezvoc">Cezvoc</ap-link-button>, who offered to grant him power
    if he was to "finish" the monster plague, namely by spreading it over the whole world.
</p>
<p>
    Joll accepted this power and used it to escape his imprisonment. Now, he wanders for settlement to settlement, planting 
    <ap-link-button linkName="noble-cezvoc">Cezvoc</ap-link-button> cults in order to power up his god and gather enough worshippers
    to perform the final ritual to spread the monster plague over the world.
