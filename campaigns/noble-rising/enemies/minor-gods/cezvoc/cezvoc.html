<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Typical depictions of Cezvoc portray him as a roughly 5' 5" tall male wizard, covered in dark robes with a wyvern-like tail, necks and heads like a 3-headed hydra,
    body plates like a bulette, and frost-spewing claws resembling a winter wolf's teeth, carrying a 6 foot tall staff topped with a spiked hammer in his right hand/claw and
    a scroll, or book, in his left hand/claw. In colored depictions, Cezvoc is orange in color with a dark blue mist surrounding him.

<h2 id="worship">Worship</h2>
<p>
    The worship of Cezvoc is performed either in small, scattered cults or on one's own. Worshipers of Cezvoc often engage in public conflict, ranging
    from yelling matches to bar fights to blood sports and war, though those who worship his magical side are often far sneakier. For those few, learning
    dark magics and creating monsters takes priority of making displays of aggression.

<p>
    In areas where Cezvoc has achieved control of the majority, his followers will dig out blood pits and line them with logs (to strengthen the construction).
    The pits have no entrances or exits, with combatants simply being dumped or pushed in, with the final survivor being offered a rope ladder. Many of these
    fights pit people against monsters, though when they can, the worshipers of Cezvoc are more than happy to have two starving monsters fight each other.
