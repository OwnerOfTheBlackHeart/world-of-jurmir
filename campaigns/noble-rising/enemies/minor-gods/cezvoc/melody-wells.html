<p>
	<i class="power">Dual Mind (Ex):</i> Melody gets 2 initiatives per combat round, one for her barbarian class (and movement) and one for her
    bard class abilities (which cannot move). Her bard initiative can act normally even while raging.
</p>

<p>
	<i class="power">Greater Rage (Ex):</i> Melody can fly into a rage a certain number of times per day. In a rage, Melody temporarily 
    gains a +6 bonus to Strength, a +6 bonus to Constitution, and a +3 morale bonus on Will saves, but she takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. 
    The increase in Constitution increases the barbarian’s hit points by 3 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the rage 
    when her Constitution score drops back to normal. (These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are.) While raging, 
    Melody cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except for Balance, Escape Artist, Intimidate, and Ride), 
    the Concentration skill, or any abilities that require patience or concentration, nor can she cast spells or activate magic items that 
    require a command word, a spell trigger (such as a wand), or spell completion (such as a scroll) to function. She can use any feat she has 
    except Combat Expertise, item creation feats, and metamagic feats. A fit of rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character’s 
    (newly improved) Constitution modifier. Melody may prematurely end her rage. At the end of the rage, the barbarian loses the rage 
    modifiers and restrictions and becomes fatigued (-2 penalty to Strength, -2 penalty to Dexterity, can’t charge or run) for the duration 
    of the current encounter.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</i> Melody retains her Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if she is caught flat-footed or 
    struck by an invisible attacker and cannot be flanked, except by rogues at least 4 levels higher than her own. However, she still loses her 
    Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.

<ul class="list">
    <li>
        When not being the Champion of <ap-link-button linkName="noble-cezvoc">Cezvoc</ap-link-button>, Melody performs and teaches at local
        <ap-link-button linkName="lindo">Lindo</ap-link-button> churches.
    </li>
</ul>
	
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Melody is a 6' tall, female aasimar with neatly kept, mid-back length flowing pearly hair, lightly tanned skin, E (DD) cup titties, golden eyes and a motherly figure.
    Melody normally wears a colorful dress with a set of vivid scarves that she can move about as she performs, along with shining gold jewelry studded with cheap,
    but shiny, gems. Her combat garb is a beaten, but well made, mithral breastplate paired with a flaming, two-handed flail and a high draw weight longbow.
</p>
<p>
    Melody's normal appearance is partially illusion. When the illusion is dropped (such as when Melody rages), Melody has a wild and violent look to her with
    reddish-black eyes, unkempt hair and a powerful, muscled build.
</p>
<p>
    Melody has an attractiveness of 9.
</p>

<h2 id="hertory-and-motivation">History and Motivation</h2>
<p>
    Melody was named for the fact that her cries upon birth were melodious and beautiful, which made her parent believe her to be a gift
    from <ap-link-button linkName="lindo">Lindo</ap-link-button>. As Melody grew older, her parents pushed her to study and practice among
    the local lindite church, which she excelled at; However, the whole time Melody struggled with a terrible temper.
</p>
<p>
    When she had hit puberty, Melody calmed down, gaining far better control of her emotions. Her parents and the lindites thanked 
    <ap-link-button linkName="lindo">Lindo</ap-link-button> for her sudden maturity. The reality, however, was that Melody had found the
    local <ap-link-button linkName="noble-cezvoc">Cezvoc</ap-link-button> cult and joined them, letting out her vicious nature in the battle pit and fully falling,
    using her bardic magic to conceal the evidence of her fall.
