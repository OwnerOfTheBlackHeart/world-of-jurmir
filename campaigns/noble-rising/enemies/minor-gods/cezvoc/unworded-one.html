<p>
	<i class="power">Spell-like abilities:</i> Always active—see <i>invisibility</i>; at will—<i>detect magic</i>, <i>invisibility</i>; 1/day—<i>plane shift</i>. 
    Caster level equals spell weaver’s effective sorcerer level; save DC 15 + spell level.
</p>

<p>
	<i class="power">Chromatic Disk:</i> The Unworded One is never without its chromatic disk. This 6-inch-diameter indestructible disk glows with colors that 
    slowly shift through the spectrum. This object stores ten additional spell levels of energy that The Unworded One can tap and use as it wishes.
    To tap this spell energy, The Unworded One must hold the chromatic disk in at least one of its hands. The disk automatically recharges itself to full 
    power every night, at midnight. A spell powered by the disk is cast as though the caster had the Spell Focus feat for the spell in question.
</p>
<p>
    Only a spell weaver can utilize a chromatic disk. Should any other creature pick one up and try to tap its energy (by employing the Use Magic Device skill, 
    for instance), it explodes, dealing 4d10 points of damage to everything within a 30-foot radius.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Shielded Mind (Ex):</i> Attempts by creatures of other races to communicate telepathically with The Unworded One, or to read its mind, always
    fail. A creature making such an attempt must succeed at a Will save (DC 21) or be affected as if by a confusion spell (caster level equals The Unworded One’s
    effective sorcerer level) for 1d6 days. This effect can be dispelled or removed with a heal effect.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Spell Weaving (Ex):</i> These monsters are infamous for their ability to cast more than one spell at a time. Casting a spell occupies a 
    number of The Unworded One arms equal to the spell’s level (maximum 6th). The Unworded One can cast more than one spell simultaneously, as long as the 
    sum of the spell levels is six or less (A single 0-level spell occupies one arm).
</p>
<p>
    Casting a spell of a spell level of 7, or greater, requires the use of all arms.
</p>

<b>Sorcerer Spells</b>
<p>
    The Unworded One casts as a sorcerer of 2 levels higher than its hit dice (17).
