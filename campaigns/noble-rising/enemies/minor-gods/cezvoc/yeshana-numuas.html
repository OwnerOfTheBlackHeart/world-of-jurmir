<p>
    Yeshana is 5' 9" tall catfolk-aberration dragon hybrid with matte black fur, ass-length black hair in a braided pony-tail with a tuft of black hair
    covering from her shoulders to the tops of her D-cup breasts (which hides a second, large mouth), four arms, and golden-yellow eyes with cat-like
    slit pupils.
</p>
<p>
    Yeshana typically wears her "<a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/257802464487669761/964040962068348968/unknown.png" target="_blank">princess dress</a>,"
    a small, silver dress with red accents that mostly covers her waist with deep cleavage that goes to just above the knees with a split in the sides. For jewelry,
    Yeshana wears a silver choker with a ruby in the center, a silver signet ring, 2 silver bracelets, and a pair of silver rings with inset red spinel. When she goes to
    court, Yeshana wears a golden chain over her chest mouth.
