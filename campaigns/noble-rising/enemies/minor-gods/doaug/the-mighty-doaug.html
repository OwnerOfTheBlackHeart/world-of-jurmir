<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	The Mighty Doaug is a male german shepard with dark blue scales instead of fur, a vicious looking maw, clawed front paws, and rippling muscle. He is always
    near, or wielding, his +3 bastard sword, Nabela.
</p>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>
    The Mighty Doaug was born as a typical blue, half-dragon german shepard. He wandered the world for a while, fighting anything that caught his eye and conquering
    settlements he encountered. After having conquered 5 villages through intimidation alone, Kyranious granted him minor godhood under her as a god of conquest,
    honorable combat and war.
</p>
<p>
    When the Mighty Doaug conquers a settlement, he does nothing to defend it or to maintain power over it. He conquers solely for the purpose of proving his strength.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
    The Mighty Doaug dives into fights without any concern for himself, or those around him. Once in a fight, he attacks with his bastard sword and claws, stopping to
    cast buffing magic if he feels threatened. The Mighty Doaug may also stop fighting and start buffing if he is present to witness incredible valor.
