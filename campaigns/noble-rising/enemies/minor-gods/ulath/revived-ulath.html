<p>
    <i class="power">Poison (Ex):</i>
    Ulath's saliva carries a potent toxin that, when introduced to the bloodstream, weakens and stiffens muscles. Ulath's bite applies the following
    poison:<br/>
    <b>Injury</b> DC 23, <b>Initial Damage</b> 1d4 Str + 1d4 Dex, <b>Secondary Damage</b> 1d6 Str + 1d6 Dex
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Disease (Su):</i>
    The filth built up on the claws of Ulath posses a magically empowered version of filth fever. When an opponent takes damage from Ulath's claws,
    they must roll a DC 23 fortitude save or become infected with an enhanced version of filth fever that deals 1d4 dex and 1d4 con damage and takes
    immediate effect, dealing the damage upon infection. The DC of the enhanced filth fever is 23 and the enhanced version of filth fever appears as
    a necromany effect to detect magic. Dispelling the infection turns it into a standard case of the filth fever.
</p>
<p>
    A creature already infected by filth fever, or an enhanced version of filth fever, is unaffected by this ability.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">God of Destruction (Su):</i>
    Being that Ulath is a god of destruction, his attacks and spells bypass 10 damage reduction, hardness, or energy resistance, regardless of if they
    normally would.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Stench (EX):</i>
    When Ulath is angry or frightened, he secretes an oily, musk-like chemical that nearly every
    form of animal life finds offensive. All living creatures (except troglodytes) within 30 feet of Ulath must
    succeed on a DC 23 Fortitude save or be sickened for 10 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Creatures
    that successfully save cannot be affected by Ulathâ€™s stench for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize
    poison spell removes the effect from the sickened creature. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and 
    creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Spells:</i> Ulath casts as though a 14th level sorcerer.

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
	Ulath appears as a 8 foot tall, 14 foot long tauric combination of a troglodyte and a massive monitor lizard, with the pale blue scales he
    had in life and a mix of oily slime and refuse covering his body. The troglodyte torso of Ulath appears almost bursting with muscle, while
    his lightly glowing yellow eyes bare down on all with a cruel and hateful gaze.
