<p>
	<i class="power">Stench (Ex)</i>
	When a troglodyte is angry or frightened, it secretes an oily, musk-like chemical that nearly every form of animal life finds offensive. 
	All living creatures (except troglodytes) within 30 feet of a troglodyte must succeed on a DC 14 Fortitude save or be sickened for 10 
	rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Creatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same troglodyteâ€™s stench for 24 
	hours. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect from the sickened creature. Creatures with immunity to poison are 
	unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws.
