		<i class="power">Stench (EX):</i>
		When a troglodyte is angry or frightened, it secretes an oily, musk-like chemical that nearly every
		form of animal life finds offensive. All living creatures (except troglodytes) within 30 feet of a troglodyte must
		succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or be sickened for 10 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based. Creatures
		that successfully save cannot be affected by the same troglodyteâ€™s stench for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize
		poison spell removes the effect from the sickened creature. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and 
		creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws.
	</p>

	<p>
		<i class="power">Godly Powers (SU):</i>
		When struck by a weapon or object made of copper or bronze, Ulath loses his regeneration, damage
		reduction and his energy resistances. This effect lasts for 1 round. He also loses these powers
		so long as he is in contact with an object made of copper or bronze, and 1 round after ceasing
		contact with such an item.
