<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
	This catfolk wears dirty vestments that are reinforced by hard leather. It raises a small symbol and prays for protection
	as the fight begins.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
	Equally as capable up close as from a distance, the catfolk adept takes place wherever they are needed in a fight. Much
	like commoners, the catfolk adept would rather live to fight another day than fight to the death.
