<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
	Hamahakki appears as a 29 foot long spider made of swirling, gray mist with a thin, 5 foot tall torso, 24 eyes that glow a pale blue, and unnaturally long (even for
    her size) chelicerae/mandibles. Even when her fangs are retracted into her chelicerae, the tips of the obsidian black fangs can be seen, dripping venom. The mere
    presence of Hamahakki, or her avatar, causes dense spider webs to form rapidly.

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>
    Little is known about Hamahakki's life before becoming a minor god, as the goddess does not care to tell stories. The first records of Hamahakki's presence indicate
    that other minor gods managed to force her out of prior home, a point of convergence between the upperdark and underdark that was filled with a perpetual mist,
    which caused Hamahakki to move into the caves within the lands of <ap-link-button linkName="noble-methnaes">Methnaes</ap-link-button>.
</p>
<p>
    The arrival of Hamahakki immediately proved problematic for <ap-link-button linkName="noble-methnaes">Methnaes</ap-link-button>, as her cults quickly began hunting
    and killing, and her presences brought with it a rise in venomous spiders. Initially believing them to simply be half-mad mages practicing dark magics,
    <ap-link-button linkName="noble-methnaes">Methnaes</ap-link-button> simply killed or sacrificed any followers of Hamahakki they found. However, as the problem became
    progressively worse, <ap-link-button linkName="noble-methnaes">Methnaes</ap-link-button> realized it was the work of a minor god and began hunting down
    Hamahakki and her cults.
</p>
<p>
    These hunts were initially successful, managing to kill or capture most of the weaker Hamahakki cults. The hunts only left the stronger, more capable cults behind,
    causing <ap-link-button linkName="noble-methnaes">Methnaes</ap-link-button> to reorient its focus to killing Hamahakki, which caused Hamahakki to grow stronger as
    she fed upon her hunters. Realizing their mistake, <ap-link-button linkName="noble-methnaes">Methnaes</ap-link-button> swapped back to trying to eliminate
    Hamahakki's cults while they look for a way to trap or kill Hamahakki.
</p>
<p>
    At the current moment <ap-link-button linkName="noble-methnaes">Methnaes</ap-link-button> continues to actively hunt Hamahakki's cults, though they are only able to
    take them out fast enough prevent the situation from worsening, and the fact Hamahakki so easily attracts drow to her worship is not making the situation any easier.
