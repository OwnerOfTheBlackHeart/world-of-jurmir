<p>
	<i class="power">Attach (Ex):</i> If a snapping turtle hits with a bite attack, it uses its powerful jaws to latch onto the opponent’s body
	and automatically deals bite damage each round it remains attached. The Turtle must be attached to start using its claws (2 claws -1 melee (1d2+1)) 
	against the target's touch. An attached turtle loses its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class and has an AC of 16. An attached turtle can be struck with 
	a weapon or grappled itself. To remove an attached turtle through grappling, the opponent must achieve a pin against the creature.
</p>

<p>
	<i class="power">Camouflage (Ex):</i> An alligator snapping turtle can spend a full round action to become camouflaged. This requires the turtle
	to remain completely still while in water, causing the alligator snapping turtle to lose its camouflage after taking any actions. When camouflaged,
	an alligator snapping turtle may attempt to hide with a minimum total roll of 20, can stay underwater for a number of minutes equal to 4 x its 
	Constitution score before risking drowning, and gains a +10 to surprise round attacks from camouflage. Any creature with an intelligence of 6, or 
	greater, that witnesses an alligator snapping turtle enter camouflage knows where the alligator snapping turtle is until to moves.
</p>

<p>
	<i class="power">Water's Edge (Ex):</i> When attempting to use the hide skill while underwater and near the edge of the water, an alligator snapping turtle 
	can lie in the water with only its eyes and nostrils showing, gaining a +10 cover bonus on Hide checks (only applies to those spotting from outside the water). 
	An alligator snapping turtle using Water's Edge may also use Camouflage.
</p>

<p>
	<i class="power">Hold Breath (Ex):</i> An alligator snapping turtle can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to 4 × its Constitution score before it risks drowning.
</p>

<p>
	<i class="power">Swim Speed (Ex):</i> An alligator snapping turtle can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. It can 
	use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.
