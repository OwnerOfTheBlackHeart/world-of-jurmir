<h1>Aberration Dragon</h1>
<ap-image linkName="noble-aberration-dragon-img" class="character-picture" height="500">Picture of an Aberration Dragon</ap-image>
<p>
    Aberration dragons are a strange mockery of dragons, appearing as if a wingless dragon without wings and with a massive mouth that goes halfway along
    the back of the creature with half of the mouth appearing to use the aberration dragon's ribs as teeth. An aberration dragon appears to have no eyes.
</p>
<p>
    Aberration dragons live underground in large tunnels they dig out, designed to confuse intruders and offer the aberration dragon plenty of time
    to stalk, analyse and attack its prey. Aberration dragons love to construct pitfall traps and magical alarms in their lairs so that they are always
    aware of when prey has entered their home. Aberration dragons typically make their "private quarters" in areas inaccessible to intruders, such as a
    chamber that is only accessible through a hole in the ceiling.
</p>
<p>
    Much like normal dragons, aberration dragons create large hordes of valuable goods. Unlike normal dragons, aberration dragons prefer treasure that is
    useful to humanoids, such as magic items, weapons, armor, advanced materials like adamantine, and platinum coins, which they do not collect for their
    own joy, but instead as bait for greedy humanoids. The horde of an aberration dragon is kept at the deepest part of their lairs and far away from the
    parts of the lair where the aberration dragon actually lives.
</p>
<p>
    Aberration dragons are highly intelligent and build up large repositories of knowledge over the courses of their lives. They value forbidden knowledge
    above all else, followed closely by arcane knowledge, then historical knowledge. Those seeking dark knowledge have been rumored to seek out aberration 
    dragons to trade knowledge or food with, though the success of such endeavors is unknown.

        An aberration dragon possesses 2 breath weapons: A line of psychic energy that deals wisdom damage and a cone of 
        <ap-link-button linkName="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/confusion.htm">confusion</ap-link-button>. The saves are intelligence based.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using a breath weapon is a standard action. Once a dragon breathes, it can’t breathe again until 1d4 rounds later. Even though an aberration dragon has more than one type of 
        breath weapon, it still can breathe only once every 1d4 rounds. A blast from a breath weapon always starts at any intersection adjacent to the dragon and extends in a 
        direction of the dragon’s choice, with an area as noted on the table below. If the breath weapon deals damage, creatures caught in the area can attempt Wisdom saves 
        to take half damage; the DC depends on the aberration dragon’s age, and is given in each individual entry. Saves against the nondamaging breath weapon use the 
        same DC Wisdom save. The save DC against a breath weapon is 10 + ½ aberration dragon’s HD + aberration dragon’s Int modifier.
    </p>
    <p>
        The size of an aberration dragons breath weapons depends on its size.

<h3>Combat</h3>
<p>
    Aberration dragons prefer to fight carefully, hiding in the shadows of the ceiling of their cave-like liars while observing their prey. After they have studied
    their prey, aberration dragons may attempt to distract or confuse their prey. Older aberration dragons like to use shape stone and wall of stone to force
    parties to become separated, where they can attack smaller groups.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Improved Grab (Ex)</i><br/>
    To use this ability, a young, or older, aberration dragon must hit an opponent of up to its size with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a 
    grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can try to swallow the foe the following round.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Swallow Whole (Ex)</i><br/>
    A aberration dragon can try to swallow a grabbed opponent of up to one size smaller by making a successful grapple check. The swallowed creature takes a bite attack worth
    of damage plus 1d6 acid damage per round. A swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or piercing weapon to deal one tenth the aberration dragon's hit 
    points of damage to the inside of the mouth (AC 10 + ½ its natural armor bonus). Once the creature exits, muscular action closes the mouth; another swallowed opponent must 
    cut its own way out. An aberration dragon that has swallowed a target can't use its bite attack until the swallowed creature is killed or escapes.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Breath Weapon (Su)</i><br/>
    An aberration dragon has two types of breath weapons: A line of wisdom damage and a cone of 
    <ap-link-button linkName="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/confusion.htm">confusion</ap-link-button>.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Spider Climb (Su)</i><br/>
    An aberration dragon is treated as being constantly under the effects of the spell 
    <ap-link-button linkName="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/spiderClimb.htm">spider climb</ap-link-button> with a caster level equal to half the aberration dragon's
    hit dice. If dispelled, this effect can be reactivated as a free action on the aberration dragon's turn.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Blindsight (Ex)</i><br/>
    An aberration dragon's skin serves as a sensory organ that can ascertain prey by scent and vibration within 60 feet.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Charm Aberrations (Sp)</i><br/>
    A great wyrm aberration dragon can use this ability 3 times per day. It works as a mass charm spell that affects only aberrations. The aberration dragon can 
    communicate with any charmed aberrations as though casting a tongues spell. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)</i><br/>
    3/day—<i>alarm</i>, <i>darkness</i> (juvenile or older; radius 10 feet per age category), <i>shape stone</i> (adult or older), <i>detect thoughts</i> (old or older),
    <i>wall of stone</i> (ancient or older)

    Concentration, Escape Artist, Intimidate, Knowledge (arcana, history, dungeoneering, religion), Sense Motive, Hide, Move Silently, Climb, Jump, Profession (miner), 
    and Use Magic Device are class skills for aberration dragons.
