    <i class="power">Blinding Flare (Su):</i>
    The flames of the candles on the back of a cryptstalker are magical in nature and, as a standard action, the cryptstalker can cause their flames to
    become a blinding flare. All creatures within 20 feet of the cryptstalker (excepting other cryptstalkers and blind creatures) must make a DC 21 fortitude 
    save. If the creature succeeds, it is blinded until the end of its next turn. If a creature fails, they are blinded for 2d4 rounds. A cryptstalker may use
    blinding flare a number of times per day equal to its constitution modifier. The save DC is constitution based.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Beetle Swarm (Sp/Ex):</i>
    Inside the skulls and pockmarks of every cryptstalker live hundreds of small, flesh-eating beetles. As a standard action, the cryptstalker can command the
    beetles to swarm in a 15 foot cube with a center no more than 60 feet away. Any living creature, except cryptstalkers, within the swarm's cube takes 
    3d10 slashing and piercing damage at the start of their turn. After 1d6 turns, the beetles return to the cryptstalker and beetle swarm can be used again.
</p>
<p>
    The command action of beetle swarm is a spell-like ability, and can be dispelled and countered as such, but once the beetles themselves are deployed, it is an extraordinary
    ability.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Beetle Wall (Sp/Ex):</i>
    Inside the skulls and pockmarks of every cryptstalker live hundreds of small, flesh-eating beetles. As a standard action, the cryptstalker can command the
    beetles to swarm in a 30 foot wide, 15 foot tall, 5 foot deep wall with a center no more than 60 feet away. Any living creature, except cryptstalkers, within the swarm's 
    wall takes 5d10 slashing and piercing damage when they enter the wall and at the start of their turn. After 1d6 turns, the beetles return to the cryptstalker 
    and beetle wall can be used again.
</p>
<p>
    The command action of beetle swarm is a spell-like ability, and can be dispelled and countered as such, but once the beetles themselves are deployed, it is an extraordinary
    ability.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Rotting Touch (Su):</i>
    The touch of a cryptstalker deals 1d6 negative energy damage. If a creature is in contact with a cryptstalker at the start of their turn, such as when grappling,
    they take 1d6 negative energy damage. A cryptstalker can disable or enable this ability as a free action once per turn.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Undead Invisibility (Su):</i>
    Undead are completely incapable of perceiving, thinking about, or knowing about cryptstalkers. If an intelligent undead perceives undeniable evidence of the
    existence of one, or more, cryptstalkers, they immediately begin rationalizing the evidence in a manner that denies the existence of cryptstalkers.

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Cryptstalkers appear as a pile of skulls with candles, 4 limbs and an eyeless face with pockmarked skin, several small, bony spikes around their joints, and 
    mouths are filled with small, blade-like teeth. When angered, a loud buzzing can be heard from within the cryptstalker.
</p>
<p>
    When waiting for prey to enter their crypt or dungeon, cryptstalkers appear as nothing more than a pile of skulls with mourning candles placed atop them. If
    one watches the pile closely, they may see an occasional skull turn to face them.
</p>
<p>
    Cryptstalkers are omnivores with a heavy preference for meat, their favorite being adventurers, though they are quite happy with priests and other servants
    of a church, and will take humanoid meat over animal meat if they have the choice. If unable to find a living creature to eat, cryptstalkers will prefer fungus,
    then fruits then vegetables (preferably roots) and finally undead flesh, which cryptstalkers consider a last resort.
</p>
<p>
    Individuals who are aware of the presence of a cryptstalker may be able to bribe it with a bound, living humanoid, especially if the humanoid is an adept or
    cleric. This only works if the cryptstalker views accepting the bribe as a better choice than killing the briber and eating both them and the bribe, which
    usually requires the briber to take the bribe directly to the cryptstalker, or otherwise display that they know the exact location of the cryptstalker.
</p>
<p>
    If a cryptstalker is successfully bribed, they may offer dark knowledge, information about their crypt or dungeon, or to serve as a guide, as appropriate to the
    bribe.
</p>
<p>
    Cryptstalkers like to organize the loot within crypts and dungeons so that it forces adventurers to engage the strongest creatures in order to get at the loot.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
    Cryptstalkers are opportunists and ambushers that like to use their invisibility to undead to their fullest advantage, and they will rarely fight in locations
    where they are far from undead, even if only simple skeletons or zombies. Once their targets have moved passed, and failed to notice, the cryptstalker, it will
    begin following them until it is either detected or finds a good hallway to attack in.
</p>
<p>
    When the cryptstalker begins its attack, its first priority is blocking its prey from exiting the crypt or dungeon. If the crypt is narrow enough that the
    cryptstalker can entirely block the escape, then it will open with either a beetle swarm or a good old sneak attack, otherwise it will use beetle wall to block
    what portion of the hallway the cryptstalker can't. From here the cryptstalker will try to push its prey into undead to further weaken them and, if too many of
    its prey get within 20 feet of it, the cryptstalker will attempt to blind them. A cryptstalker's preferred use of its beetles is to direct the movements of its
    prey, though cryptstalkers are far from above using their beetles to punish tightly bunched, and trapped, groups of prey.
</p>
<p>
    Cryptstalkers distrain traps, as they make their food difficult to get to, and they will endeavor to avoid pushing their prey towards any such devices they are
    aware of. However, if the cryptstalker is forced to flee or considers itself in serious danger, it will have no qualms about using traps to its advantage.
