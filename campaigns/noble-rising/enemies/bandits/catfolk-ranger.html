<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
	This catfolk wears a green and brown cloak covered in native vegetation and leather armor that tightly hugs its form.
	In its hands rests a bow with an arrow knocked and ready to fly while a warhammer rest at its hip for when enemies get
	too close.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
	A catfolk ranger will try to avoid being caught in a melee as much as possible. However, they do like to strike from
	amushes, utalizing their stealth skills to get the drop on their opponents and kill them as quickly as possible. When
	in a straight up fight, the catfolk ranger will let animals and warriors fight in the front while providing attacks
	from its bow.
