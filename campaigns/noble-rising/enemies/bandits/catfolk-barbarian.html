<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	This catfolk wears well cared for scale mail overtop of a basic wool or hide tunic. Over its chest it has a longbow with a
	quiver on its hip and a two-handed axe over its back. It also bears many scars and thick muscle.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
	While able to fight from a range, the catfolk barbarian prefers to get as close as possible before flying into the trademark
	rage of the wild. If forced to fight from a range, the catfolk barbarian prefers to take out those that appear to have ranged
	options, preferably before they have the chance to use them.
