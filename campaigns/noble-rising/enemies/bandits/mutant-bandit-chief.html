<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
	This catfolk wears well cared for scale mail overtop of a nice hide tunic. Over its chest it has a longbow with a
	quiver on its hip and a two-handed axe over its back. It also bears many scars, seriated horns, a long and thick tail
	for a catfolk, and thick muscle.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
	While able to fight from a range, the mutated bandit chief prefers to get as close as possible before flying into the trademark
	rage of the wild. If forced to fight from a range, the mutated bandit chief prefers to take out those that appear to have ranged
	options, preferably before they have the chance to use them.
