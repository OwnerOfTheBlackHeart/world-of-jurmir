<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
	This catfolk wears revealing leathers that show off their pale white fur while holding a crossbow or small mace. In their
	eyes lies a certain, somewhat terrifying aggression.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
	The catfolk sorcerer prefers to start a fight by casting mage armor and tagging its intended target with touch of fatigue
	before closing in and using burning hands and shocking grasp to cause as much damage as possible before backing off and
	using its light crossbow to harass enemies that have avoided the melee. In certain groups, the sorcerer doesn't join the
	fight until things have gone south, using message to keep in contact with superiors and to maintain organization on the
	battlefield.
