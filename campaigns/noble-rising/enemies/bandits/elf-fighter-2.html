<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	This elven fighter wears a set of well made chainmail with an artistically made heavy wooden shield, bearing a longsword at his hip and a longbow on his back.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
    The elven fighter will mix his combat style as the battlefield requires, charging in to form a metal wall or using his longbow to chip away at his opponents while
    his allies fight them in melee.
