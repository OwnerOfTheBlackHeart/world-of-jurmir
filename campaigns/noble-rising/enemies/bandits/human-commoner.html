<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	This human commoner wears armor that looks like a thick quilt. They hold a single weapon that they are trained in
	the use of and cower in place, hoping to return to their family.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
	The human commoner doesn't willingly fight on their own. If there is no source of "encouragement" the commoner will
	run at their first chance or otherwise surrender. If they have encouragement, they will attack in groups in an
	attempt to overcome their opponent.
