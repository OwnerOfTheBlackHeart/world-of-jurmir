<h2>Random Findings of Note</h2>
<ul class="list">

</ul>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	Quilynn is a 5' 1" tall, female elf with a sturdy, muscular look to her, D cup breasts, short, golden blonde hair, and blue-green eyes. 
	She typically wears a suit of enchanted full plate that has designs illustrating every battle it has been in. When she goes into a 
	fight, a new design appears on the armor. She is armed with a bastard sword for her primary weapon, and a light steel shield for 
	extra protection.
</p>
<p>
	Quilynn is generally cold in demeanor, if only because she understands just how many dark forces surround her. She can soften up quite
	significantly when around people that she trusts or cares about. Despite her cold treatment of others, she truly does have their best
	interests at heart.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
	Quilynn prefers to start combat by charging in with her bastard sword and taking down those who prevent her allies from
	advancing. If she cannot jump into a melee, she will use her bow to attempt to take down any spell casters she can spot.

	<h2>History and Motivation</h2>
	<p>
		Quilynn is a member of the Order of the Red Sun and has been in charge of maintaining 
		<ap-link-button linkName="noble-deathfall">Deathfall Village</ap-link-button> for twelve years. She has made good progress,
		but the volume of crime and cult activities still far outweighs her guards' capacity.
