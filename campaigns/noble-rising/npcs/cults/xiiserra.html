<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Xiiserra is a 4' 11" tall female pantherfolk with spiked black hair that holds totems depicting fire and food, C cup titties, green eyes and
    a sturdy build. When not wearing her ornate mithral chainshirt, Xiiserra wears either a modest set of orange and brown robes with embroidery depicting
    a large feast or a fire orange binder (that does little to hide her bust) under a tight fitting wolf-hide vest with a giant viper skin skirt.
    Xiiserra also wears a neutral gray cloth cloak.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
    Xiiserra will generally try to run if engaged in solo combat, using expeditious retreat to gain as much distance as she can. If she has allies, she will wait for
    them to get in position, then move around and flank. If she believes she could take her target out in a single sneak attack, she'll attack with her crossbow,
    possibly using one of her scrolls of true strike to ensure the attack hits.
</p>
<p>
    Xiiserra normally saves her spells and scrolls for out of combat use, with the exception of mirror image, which she'll use if she expects to be attacked.
</p>

<h2 id="history-and-motivation">History and Motivation</h2>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm camilia-history noble-full">
    <p>
        Xiiserra is unlikely to tell her actual history, but will happily regale those who ask with some tale they'll believe.
    </p>
</ap-auth-container>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm camilia-motivation noble-full">
    <p>
        Xiiserra knows the risk of <ap-link-button linkName="noble-calmers-of-the-flame-lord">Kugmoxon</ap-link-button> awakening and the power he offers. While she
        does her best to keep him "calmed," Xiiserra also tries to curry his favor and gain power from him.
