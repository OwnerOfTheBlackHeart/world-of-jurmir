<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
	Dolph is a beefy gnome standing at 3ft weighing in at 50lbs. Dolph towers over other gnomes with his bulging muscles and 
	stern demeanor. He has hair as soft as the sun's rays and eyes as bright and fierce as an ocean raging in a storm. 
	Dolph's body is modified by his darling wife.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
	Punch, punch, punch.
</p>
<h2 id="history-and-motivation">History and Motivation</h2>
<p>
	No one is really sure where Dolph was born or how he travelled to Taaira Ruzara, but he did travel here with his wife
	<ap-link-button linkName="noble-zigni">Zigni</ap-link-button>. While his current goals seem to align with his wife's,
	he spent most of his life trying to gain enough power to kill a dragon with his bare fists. He has killed 3 dragons so
	far, but their size and color is unknown.
