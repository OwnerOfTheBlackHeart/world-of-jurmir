	<i class="power">Improved Grab (Ex):</i> To use this ability, a tiger must hit with a claw or bite attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple 
	as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can rake.
</p>

<p>
	<i class="power">Pounce (Ex):</i> If a tiger charges a foe, it can make a full attack, including two rake attacks.
</p>

<p>
	<i class="power">Rake (Ex):</i> Attack bonus +9 melee, damage 1d8+3.
