<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
	The Mysterious Stranger appears at the beginning of combat and attacks with his revolver if an enemy is within range.
	If an enemy is too far away, the Mysterious Stranger will pull his lever action rifle and open fire. He defends himself
	at melee range through the use of haymakers and kicks. At the end of combat, the Mysterious Stranger uses his Cape of the
	Mountebank to disappear into smoke.
