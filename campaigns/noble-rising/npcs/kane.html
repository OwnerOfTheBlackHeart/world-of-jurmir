<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	Kane is a 5' 11" tall male human with a 6 inch long, black ponytail without bangs, purple eyes, tanned skin and
	slightly rounded features. He has a warriors build, with a respectable mix of fat and muscle and innumerable
	small scars scattered across his form. When not in his stylistically crafted full plate (which displays a pack
	of hyenas and a pack of lions fighting), he wears layered furs with gold and silvered weaved into them, but
	little jewelry.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
	Kane is used to having a certain feeling of invincibility and fights like it. He starts fights by charging them,
	but staying at a normal human pace. Once he has engaged a target, if they attempt to run away, he will then attempt
	to run them down and continue the fight. Even if brought to low health, Kane keeps fighting. If not fully killed,
	Kane will wait a while to heal after regaining consciousness before engaging his target again.
</p>

<h2>History and Motivation</h2>
<p>
	Kane was adopted by his father after he was found in a gnoll camp that had been cleansed. He grew up learning the
	martial arts so that he could face his father in an arena fight to take his title and property. After 3 tries, Kane
	was able to overcome his father and spared him, taking his father's title and property and giving his father a comfortable
	retirement.
</p>
<p>
	In keeping with the tradition of his family, Kane holds annual tournaments in the arena where he puts his title and
	property on the line.
