<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	Zigni is a 2' 3" tall kobold with stringy limbs and a sturdy frame. She has rust colored scales, large glowing red eyes and
	a tail longer than her body with a scorpion-like stinger at the end of it. Zigni doesn't normally wear any form of clothing 
	beyond a simple leather strap to hold her quiver in place. 
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
	Zigni avoids fighting in her kobold form, instead taking the form of creatures like the dire wolf or dire bat to make up for her
	own physical weakness. When she does so, she always maintains her long, powerful tail.
</p>
<h2>History and Motivation</h2>
<p>
	Zigni was born in a land that had little access to magic, one with significant superstition. She learned of her mutation based
	abilities when she wished to be like the first kobold, Kurtulmak. She was kicked out of her tribe for showing strange powers and
	used the opportunity to begin on a quest to understand her mutagenic powers and how to mutate others. She is married to the gnome
	<ap-link-button linkName="noble-dolph">Dolph</ap-link-button>, who often serves as her research assistant by acquiring new specimens
	or by watching over existing experiments. She travelled from her homeland to Taaira Ruzara with
