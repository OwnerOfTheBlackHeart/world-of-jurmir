<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	Zarsra is a 5' tall and 115 lbs in weight drow with short cut, pale blue hair, almost glowing red eyes, bark black skin, and
	a typical elven build with a little in the breasts and butt. On close inspection, Zarsra has tight, quick moving muscle just
	below her skin. Zarsra has 3 scars: A slash mark between her breasts, a claw mark across the top and back of her right shoulder
	and a burn mark on her left ass cheek. Zarsra is 135 years old.
	old.
</p>
<p>
	Zarsra has several outfits that she will wear based on the situation:
</p>
<ul class="list">
	<li>
		Her favorite "casual" outfit. A green, linen, sleeveless shirt that exposes some of Zarsra's cleavage with a matching wool
		jacket that covers up her torso and arms completely with a green wool skirt, a pair of brown leather boots, a sturdy leather 
		belt and a cloak with an ample hood. The shirt, jacket, and skirt have artistic depictions of trees, deer, and wolves embroidered
		into them, the belt is made from weaved leather strips, the cloak has a simple forest embroidered into it and the boots have 
		depictions of flowers indented into them. Not fitted, but close.
	</li>
	<li>
		A blue, wool tunic that reaches down to her knees with sleeves that end at her elbows, a solid leather belt, a pair of
		plain leather boots and a plain brown cloak. Not fitted, but close.
	</li>
	<li>
		A brown, hemp, long sleeve shirt and breaches, a blue vest, an undyed hemp belt, a pair of plain leather boots, and a plain 
		brown cloak. Not fitted, but close.
	</li>
	<li>
		Not an outfit on its own, but her favorite to wear. A red, cotton dress that goes down to her mid-calf with no sleeves that
		shows off a little cleavage. Zarsra typically wears the cloak and boots from her casual outfit.
	</li>
	<li>
		A red, silk cocktail dress, with a pair of opaque kneehighs and nice, black, leather boots with belts. Courtier’s outfit without
		jewelry. Still being made, payed in full.
	</li>
</ul>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm zarsra-personality noble-full">
    <p>
		Zarsra is a follower of her superiors, first and foremost. She is cautious and distrusting of new people and is slow to
		trust anyone who doesn't lay their intentions bare before her. She isn't afraid to try new things, but prefers to have
		solutions known to work in place for when things go wrong.
	</p>
	<p>
		Zarsra likes to be treated like a woman when outside of her armor and prefers to wear clothes intended for form over function,
		and this thought process does translate to when she is in armor where she likes to have gear that is as artistic as it is
		functional. Zarsra likes playing around with the colors unique to the surface.
	</p>
	<p>
		Zarsra is currently loyal to Sariel by agreement. She believes that the current agreement is to work with Sariel for a
		fortnight, after which she may leave at her own will, but she cannot back stab Sariel. She currently has a mild sexual
		interest in Sariel (3 good sex rolls).

<h2>Random Findings of Note</h2>
<ul class="list">
    <li>Rolled a 8 on pretty roll</li>
	<li>Rolled a 3 (out of 5, roughly C cup) on titty roll</li>
	<li>Zarsra likes dresses and artistically made gear</li>
</ul>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
	Zarsra prefers to stay near the front line, using two rapiers to tear her enemies apart as quickly as she can.
	If she feels she can't finish a fight, Zarsra has no issue with turning and running to fight another day... or
	to alert a higher power so that more appropriate responses can be sent.
</p>

<h2>History and Motivation</h2>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm zarsra-history noble-full">
    <p>
		Zarsra was born to house Strisek (bones of adamantine) in the underdark beneath Desserr to a low born mother.
		Being that her mother had no real standing, neither did Zarsra, which caused her to join the military of her
		house in the hopes of gaining training and influence. Her hopes were dashed within only a decade, when house
		Kenlyl (sworn to the blade) killed or enslaved every member of her house, herself included. Due to her low
		birth and low status, Zarsra was given a choice: Go to the surface as a slave or be sacrificed to the seals
		of the void.
    </p>
</ap-auth-container>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm zarsra-motivation noble-full">
    <p>
		Zarsra's first concern currently is to survive. She currently feels no binding to any group or philosophy
		as it currently stands. However, in time she would like to return home to cast judgement down on house
		Kenlyl for slaying her house.
