<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	A towering, 8 foot tall, dark green lizardfolk who wears full plate and wields a 
	halberd made of wood with an alchemically hardened and sharpened stone blade.
</p>
<p>
    He is looking to learn about the fates of the ancient lizardfolk empire from which
    he hales, as he was put into a magical slumber that he only recently awoken from.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
	Truzk approaches combat with a thought process of "kill it first", often charging in
	himself or bracing for an opponent's charge. This does not mean that Truzk is without
	tactics. He knows that magic users must be targeted first, even if that means engaging
	with other fighters to open up the battlefield to monks and rogues. If threatened with
	ranged fire and unable to reach the attacker in a timely manner, Truzk will seek cover
	that can be used to get close to the ranged attacker.
</p>
<h2>History and Motivation</h2>
<p>
	He is looking to learn about the fates of the ancient lizardfolk empire from which
    he hails, as he was put into a magical slumber that he only recently awoken from.
</p>
<p>
	Truzk was born in a time before gods when druidry was the only magic and the lizardfolk
	ruled all, before even the mammals were born. His armor and weapons were granted to
	him by the council of shamans before he was sealed away.
