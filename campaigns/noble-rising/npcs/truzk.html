<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    A towering, 8 foot tall, dark green lizardfolk who wears full plate and a shield
    made of enchanted wood and wields a longsword made of wood with saw-like teeth
    embedded in the blade.
</p>
<p>
    He is looking to learn about the fates of the ancient lizardfolk empire from which
    he hales, as he was put into a magical slumber that he only recently awoken from.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
	In combat Chione prefers to engage in melees, using spells to enhance her hammer
	to turn her foes into paste. If she is caught with need of ranged combat, she
	will do so.<br/>

	When she has a round or two to prep, she will use bloody blade.
</p>
<h2>History and Motivation</h2>
<p>
	He is looking to learn about the fates of the ancient lizardfolk empire from which
    he hails, as he was put into a magical slumber that he only recently awoken from.
</p>
<p>
	Truzk was born in a time before gods when druidry was the only magic and the lizardfolk
	ruled all, before even the mammals were born. His armor and weapons were granted to
	him by the council of shamans before he was sealed away.
