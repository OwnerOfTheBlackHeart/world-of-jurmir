		<i class="power">Channel Spell (Sp):</i> Yasrena can channel any spell she can cast into his melee weapon. Using this ability requires a 
		move action, and the Yasrena uses up the prepared spell or spell slot just as if he had cast the spell. The channeled spell affects the next 
		target that the spell sword successfully attacks with his weapon (saving throws and spell resistance still apply). Even if the spell normally affects
		an area or is a ray, it affects only the target. The spell is discharged from the weapon, which can then hold an other spell. Yasrena can channel 
		his spells into only one weapon at a time. Spells channeled into a weapon are lost if not used in 8 hours.

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
	Yasrena is 5' 2" tall and 117 lbs in weight with white hair, human-like ice-blue eyes, light coal skin, and 
	sharp features. She usually wears her hair in a large ponytail with two "strips" of hair on either side of
	her face. She typically wears a black leather shirt that leaves her flanks and upper back exposed with matching
	gloves and leggings, which others may consider sexually explicit while Yasrena considers it a show of confidence
	in herself. When traveling or expecting danger, Yasrena adds a pair of metal gauntlets and metal heeled boots.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
	In combat, Yasrena likes to start fights at a range, using her spells to create an initial advantage and act as
	artillery against her enemies. Once she is satisfied with the amount of damage she has dealt to her enemies,
	Yasrena will dive in to finish off her enemies with her enchanted bloodstone blade.
</p>
<p>
	If her enemies engage Yasrena before she has a chance to cast her spells, she will fight with her sword and melee
	spells (if she has them prepared).

	<h2 id="history-and-motivation">History and Motivation</h2>
	<p>
		Yasrena was born underground in the drow city of Amnoranis (beautiful guide) with purple eyes. She was born into
		a relatively low birth, taking up the sword as a means of sustaining herself. As she served her superior drowesses,
		Yasrena founder herself slowly being drawn to the Sister of Sithrak, Kriotz, much to the distaste of those around
		her.
	</p>
	<p>
		Eventually, Yasrena found that she was no longer welcome among the drow and left before they could have a chance
		to sacrifice her to the magics that seal the void. Following the visions given to her by Kriotz, Yasrena escaped
		to the surface, where she now roams from place to place while carefully avoiding settlements.
	</p>
	<p>
		She now seeks knowledge and magic, on a pilgrimage to ancient ruins and holy sites of Kriotz. Yasrena is also
		looking for tools with which to protect her from those drow houses who might still hunt her. Eventually, she
		would like to find a place that she could safely settle down and worship the Goddess of Knowledge and Magic.
