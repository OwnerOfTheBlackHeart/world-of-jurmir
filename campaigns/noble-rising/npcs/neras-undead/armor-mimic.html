<p>
	<i class="power">Adhesive (Ex):</i> A lessiarrac exudes a thick slime that acts as a powerful adhesive, holding fast any creatures or 
    items that touch it. An adhesive-covered lessiarrac automatically grapples any creature it hits with its slam attack. Opponents so 
    grappled cannot get free while the lessiarrac is alive without removing the adhesive first.
</p>
<p>
    A weapon that strikes an adhesive-coated lessiarrac is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 19 Reflex save. A successful DC 
    19 Strength check is needed to pry it off.
</p>
<p>
    Strong alcohol dissolves the adhesive, but the lessiarrac still can grapple normally. A lessiarrac can dissolve its adhesive at will, and the 
    substance breaks down 5 rounds after the creature dies.
</p>

<p>
	<i class="power">Crush (Ex):</i> A lessiarrac deals 1d6+8 points of damage with a successful grapple check.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Armor Shape (Ex):</i> This lessiarrac has the ability to become armor, attaching itself its dread aberromancer, 
    which takes a full action from both the lessiarrac and the dread aberromancer. While attached to its dread aberromancer, the lessiarrac armor
    the lessiarrac cannot take its own actions. A dread aberromancer is always considered proficient with their lessiarrac armor.
    Anyone who examines the lessiarrac armor can detect the ruse with a successful Spot check opposed by the lessiarracâ€™s Disguise check. Of course, by 
    this time it is generally far too late.
</p>
<p>
    As a full round action, a dread aberromancer who is wearing their lessiarrac armor can detach their lessiarrac armor and have it attempt to 
    restrain an enemy within 20ft, who is no more than 1 size category larger than the dread aberromancer. The lessiarrac attempts a grapple 
    check against the target. If the lessiarrac is successful, any creature of the same size, or smaller, is rendered helpless by the lessiarrac 
    completely surrounding them. If the creature is larger than the armor lessiarrac, then they are pinned as the lessiarrac takes hold of their 
    lower half. The target can attempt another grapple to escape each round.
</p>
<p>
    If the lessiarrac armor has any feats that affect the use of armor, such as Adjusted to Armor, then the dread aberromancer gains the benefits 
    of these feats while wearing the lessiarrac armor. For the sake of meeting feat prerequisites, lessiarrac armor lessiarracs count half their hit dice as fighter levels.
</p>
<p>
    This armor lessiarrac gains the benefits of nerium.
</p>
<p>
    The armor lessiarrac has access to the light armor form, which has an armor bonus of +3, a max dex of 11, armor check penalty of 0, damage reduction 1/-,
    and energy resistance fire, cold, and acid 2.
