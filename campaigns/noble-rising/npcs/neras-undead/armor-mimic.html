<p>
	<i class="power">Adhesive (Ex):</i> A mimic exudes a thick slime that acts as a powerful adhesive, holding fast any creatures or 
    items that touch it. An adhesive-covered mimic automatically grapples any creature it hits with its slam attack. Opponents so 
    grappled cannot get free while the mimic is alive without removing the adhesive first.
</p>
<p>
    A weapon that strikes an adhesive-coated mimic is stuck fast unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 20 Reflex save. A successful DC 
    20 Strength check is needed to pry it off.
</p>
<p>
    Strong alcohol dissolves the adhesive, but the mimic still can grapple normally. A mimic can dissolve its adhesive at will, and the 
    substance breaks down 5 rounds after the creature dies.
</p>

<p>
	<i class="power">Crush (Ex):</i> A mimic deals 1d6+8 points of damage with a successful grapple check.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Armor Shape (Ex):</i> This mimic has the ability to become armor, attaching itself its dread aberromancer, 
    which takes a full action from both the mimic and the dread aberromancer. While attached to its dread aberromancer, the mimic armor
    the mimic cannot take its own actions. A dread aberromancer is always considered proficient with their mimic armor.
    Anyone who examines the mimic armor can detect the ruse with a successful Spot check opposed by the mimicâ€™s Disguise check. Of course, by 
    this time it is generally far too late.
</p>
<p>
    As a full round action, a dread aberromancer who is wearing their mimic armor can detach their mimic armor and have it attempt to 
    restrain an enemy within 20ft, who is no more than 1 size category larger than the dread aberromancer. The mimic attempts a grapple 
    check against the target. If the mimic is successful, any creature of the same size, or smaller, is rendered helpless by the mimic 
    completely surrounding them. If the creature is larger than the armor mimic, then they are pinned as the mimic takes hold of their 
    lower half. The target can attempt another grapple to escape each round.
</p>
<p>
    If the mimic armor has any feats that affect the use of armor, such as Adjusted to Armor, then the dread aberromancer gains the benefits 
    of these feats while wearing the mimic armor. For the sake of meeting feat prerequisites, mimic armor mimics count half their hit dice as fighter levels.
</p>
<p>
    This armor mimic gains the benefits of nerium.
</p>
<p>
    The armor mimic has access to the light armor form, which has an armor bonus of +3, a max dex of 11, armor check penalty of 0, damage reduction 1/-,
    and energy resistance fire, cold, and acid 2.
