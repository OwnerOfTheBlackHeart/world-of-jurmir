<p>
	<i class="power">Entangle (Ex)</i> Each erinyes carries a stout rope some 50 feet long that entangles opponents of any 
    size as an animate rope spell (caster level 16th). An erinyes can hurl its rope 30 feet with no range penalty. Typically, 
    an erinyes entangles a foe, lifts it into the air, and drops it from a great height.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Spell-like abilities:</i> at willâ€”<i>greater teleport</i> (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), <i>charm monster</i> (DC 19), 
    <i>minor image</i> (DC 17), <i>unholy blight</i> (DC 19).
    Caster level 12th; The save DCs are Charisma-based.
</p>

<p>
	<i class="power">Summon Devil (Sp):</i> Once per day an erinyes can attempt to summon 2d10 lemures or 1d4 bearded devils with a 50% chance of success. 
    This ability is the equivalent of a 3rd-level spell.

<p>
    <i class="power">True Seeing (Su):</i> Erinyes continuously use true seeing, as the spell (caster level 14th).

    <li>Ashbeel has a contract with Elizabeth were both can summon each other at will</li>
    <li>Elizabeth can summon Ashbeel by sacrificing a 5th level divine spell slot or a 7th level arcane spell slot</li>
    <li>Ashbeel is focused on "divination"</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Ashbeel is a 5' 10" tall female erinyes with ass-length, flowing black hair, chestnut skin, D cup titties, red glowing eyes, large,
    deep red feathered wings, and a statuesque build. Ashbeel normally wears a leather cropped vest with a mid-calf length skirt, with a
    set of belts for holding her equipment and no boots or shoes.
</p>

    <p>
        Ashbeel is what one might expect of a devil, harsh and confident in action, with a perverse love of inflicting pain on those weaker
        than herself. However, Ashbeel is also cautious, studying a situation, or person, closely before acting decisively. When forced to
        think on her feet, Ashbeel is likely to strike fast and hard, seeking to either remove the current problem or force it back long enough
        to give her space to think and plan.
    </p>
</ap-auth-container>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
	Ashbeel prefers to stalk her prey before striking, learning the general attitudes and strengths of her foes. From there she will plan
    out how to best strike her opponents to ensure their swift destruction. Once engaged with an enemy, Ashbeel will use charm monster to
    turn the weakest willed amongst her enemies against each other before raining down flaming arrows and possibly diving down to strike with
    her sword to finish off a foe. Ashbeel may occasionally attempt to drag opponents into the sky and drop them, or use her flight to allow
    her to bull rush enemies off of elevated locations.
