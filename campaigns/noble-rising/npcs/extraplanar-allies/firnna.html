    size as an animate rope spell (caster level 16th). An erinyes can hurl its rope 30 feet with no range penalty. Typically,

    <li>
        Firnna has a contract with Nera that stipulates that so long as Nera maintains her <i>mortal</i> coil, Nera can summon her at will, 
        that she serves Nera, that she can freely act on the Material Plane, and that every sin she commits on the Material Plane is Nera's sin
        instead of hers.
    </li>
    <li>Nera can summon Firnna by sacrificing a 5th level divine spell slot or a 7th level arcane spell slot</li>
    <li>Firnna is focused on "blasting"</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Firnna is a 6' 7" tall female erinyes with shoulder length, spiky black hair, mocha skin, DD cup titties, red glowing eyes, large, black
    feathered wings and a statuesque build. Firnna normally wears an outfit that can best be described as a belt harness, to which all of her
    equipment is attached when not in use, which does nothing to cover her crotch and breasts. Firnna doesn't wear any shoes or boots, but does
    paint her nails, both finger and toe, vibrant blues, yellows and reds.

    <p>
        Firnna is surprisingly playful for a devil, at least around Nera, however she is ready at any given moment to unleash hellfire, held back
        only by the need for an excuse. Being that Firnna doesn't currently have to concern herself with committing sins, she's more than happy
        to do whatever she wants to, though she has been working towards turning <ap-link-button linkName="durn">Durn</ap-link-button> against
        <ap-link-button linkName="sithrak">Sithrak</ap-link-button> in the hopes to unbind him from <ap-link-button linkName="hell">Hell</ap-link-button>.
    </p>
</ap-auth-container>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
	Firnna likes to maintain her range during a fight, opening the engagement by unleashing a volley from her staff before using charm monster
    to turn her enemies against each other while engaging with her bow. If she has a solid reason to, Firnna will swoop in to engage her enemies
    with her longsword.
