<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Mimakin is a gold dragon roughly 16 feet long with a 5 foot long body, another 5 feet of neck, and a 6 foot long tail with a wingspan of nearly 17 feet.
    Mimakin is covered in dark yellow scales with specks of golden color occasionally showing through. Two horns protrude from Mimakin's head and a "beard of
    stubble" cover her cheek bones and lower jawbones, but are actually proto-whiskers growing in. Rather than traveling along her tail, Mimakin's wings only
    connect down to her hips and her tail ends in a spade shaped membrane. Despite her draconic head and mouthful of sharp teeth, the smile that covers Mimakin's
    face is friendly, inviting and genuine.
</p>
<p>
    In her primary disguise, Mimakin appears as a plain looking, 5' 5" female half-orc with straight, shoulder-length black hair, C cup titties, golden eyes
    and an average build. She normally wears an undyed cloth shirt and breeches with simple leather boots and a sturdy leather cloak. When traveling, she will
    wear padded armor and carry a humble spear.
</p>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm mimakin-personality noble-full">
    <p>
        Mimakin is a cheery and trusting dragon, perhaps even naive, though she isn't dumb. She simply prefers to see the best in people and believes that
        those who can be caused to seek redemption can achieve it. 
    </p>

</ul>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
    While Mimakin will adapt to any allies that she has at the time, when fighting on her own, she drops her disguise the moment combat starts, firing off her
    breath attack only when doing so would be advantageous. Normally, though, she will try to place herself in a location where she can fully utilize her
    reflexes. If her opponent(s) use ranged weapons or spells, Mimakin will use her flight to close the distance and pin down the enemy "artillery."
