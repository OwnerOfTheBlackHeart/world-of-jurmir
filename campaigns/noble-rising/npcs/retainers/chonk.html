<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
	Chonk is a towering, 9' 3" tall, coal black lizardfolk with a red, gilled looking neck, who wears shiny black full plate and wields an
    almost comically large greataxe, which has a strange sheen to it, that seems to change color each day. Along the top of his head and following
    along his spine, from the tip of his nose to the tip of his tail, Chonk occasionally applies a dark blue warpaint.
</p>
<p>
    Chonk is a warrior from an allied blackscale tribe that Nera found in the Howling Peaks, who has been assigned to learn from

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
	Chonk approaches combat with a simple philosophy: Smash everything with his axe. If faced with a ranged enemy, Chonk is liable to rip
    nearby bushes, saplings and shrubberies out of the ground and use them as impromptu javelins.
</p>

<h2 id="history-and-motivation">History and Motivation</h2>
<p>
	Chonk comes from one of the tribes of large, coal skinned lizardfolk that live within the caves and coal mines of the Howling Peaks. He is
    currently serving Baroness Nera as a way to determine what benefits working with her offers to his tribe.
