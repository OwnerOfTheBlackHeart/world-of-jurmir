<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Nui stands 4' 8" with a build between that of a human and a dwarf and has the typical dark rusty brown to rusty black scales, glowing red eyes, double kneed legs, 
    and crocodile like heads, as well as occasional, cancer-like iridescent scales, long tails ending in a viscous stinger, misaligned teeth that grow in rows like 
    sharks and bone blades that extend from their forearms. Nui is decorated with small, glowing tattoos that cover his arms and torso, with a single tattoo which
    doesn't change: On his upper right arm, near the shoulder, 5 kobolds circle the arm, appearing to be around a catfolk in a dress.
</p>
<p>
    The bone blades don't interfere with the mutated kobold's ability to use tools.
    <ap-auth-container permissions="gm noble-full mutated-kobolds-tools" inline>
        Mutated kobolds are apprehensive about tools and armor because those who drive them out of normal kobold society utilize them and they fear that if they
        begin using tools and armor, they will grow weak and lose their own will.
    </ap-auth-container>
</p>
<p>
    The kobolds afflicted with the attuned strain stand 4 to 5 feet tall and weigh 130 to 170 pounds. They have builds between a human and a dwarf and often
    decorate themselves with small, glowing tattoos that they use instinctual rituals to create.
</p>
<p>
    Like most mutated kobolds, Nui is not fond of gods, or even their concept, though he has a respect for <ap-link-button linkName="lindo">Lindo</ap-link-button>,
    who he views as caring only about the dead and those who interfere with the journeys of the soul.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
    While Nui isn't particularly intelligent, he is clever and will use group tactics and the environment to their advantage, attacking from ambushes
    and drawing enemies into choke points, utilizing flanking manuevers, and abusing the fact that he can operate the same in complete darkness as he does in bright
    daylight. Unlike normal kobolds, Nui never willingly uses traps, as he often forgets where he are placed and could get trapped in the trap himself.
</p>
<p>
    While Nui aware of the fact he has a poisonous stinger on his tail, this fact often escapes his mind, up until he is in the middle of
    a fight and attacking with everything he has.
</p>
<p>
    Nui is more confident and brave than his stalker brethren, in both his physical and magical abilities. If fought in melee, Nui will rely
    on his physical abilities. If given time to prepare, Nui likes to cast his buffing spells (such as Bull's Strength and Fire Shield), then charge a 
    Shocking Grasp and charge in with the spell the next turn. He is also liable to retreat and heal if the need and opportunity presents itself. If there are
    other mutated kobolds around, Nui is perfectly content to buff his allies and act as artillery with Fireball, Sound Burst and Magic Missile. While Nui
    takes great joy in the fight and in killing his foes, he has no interest in foes that can't fight back and leaves bodies where they lay.
