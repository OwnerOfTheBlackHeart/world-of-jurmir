<p>
    <i class="power">Rage (Ex and Su):</i> Twice per day, Falodran can call forth all his rage, as well as a little bit of Nera's, to fly into a draconic frenzy.
    While raging, Falodran temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, DR 5/-, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but he takes a -2 penalty to 
    Armor Class. The increase in Constitution increases Falodran’s hit points by 2 points per level (14), but these hit points go away at the end of the rage when his 
    Constitution score drops back to normal. (These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are.) While raging, Falodran cannot use any Charisma-, 
    Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except for Balance, Escape Artist, Intimidate, and Ride), the Concentration skill, or any abilities that require patience or 
    concentration, nor can he cast spells or activate magic items that require a command word, a spell trigger (such as a wand), or spell completion (such as a scroll) to 
    function. He can use any feat he has except Combat Expertise, item creation feats, and metamagic feats. A fit of rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + Falodran’s 
    (newly improved) Constitution modifier. A Falodran may prematurely end his rage. At the end of the rage, the Falodran loses the rage modifiers and 
    restrictions and becomes fatigued (-2 penalty to Strength, -2 penalty to Dexterity, can’t charge or run) for the duration of the current encounter.
</p>
<p>
    The DR granted by rage is a supernatural effect, though the rest of Falodran's rage is an extraordinary ability.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Wrathful (Su):</i> Due to his unnatural relentlessness and the magical wrath running through his veins, when Falodran uses the intimidate skill, he
    does so as if 1 size category larger.

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Falodran is a black dragon roughly 8 feet long with a 2 and a half foot long body, roughly 2 foot long neck (when fully extended), and a roughly 3 and a half
    foot long tail with a 13 foot wingspan. Falodran is covered in dark black scales that become a shiny, ashy gray as they get closer to his chest. His head has a
    short, almost beaked, mouth with 2 glowing red eyes and 2 pairs of long, straight horns that jut back from his skull as well as horns that jut out from his
    jaws and protect where his neck and skull meet. His shoulders posses blade-like jutting horns and his chest has a spot of hard, black horns with a slight red
    underglow. Falodran's forelimbs possess large horns jutting from the elbows like spikes, though they are normally blunted.

<ap-auth-container permissions="gm falodran-personality noble-full">
    <p>
        Falodran is a self centered idiot with delusions of grander and seemingly endless laziness. As an expression of this, Falodran has decided that
        Nera Black, and everything she owns, is a part of his horde, and he will not take challenges to that lightly.
    </p>
</ap-auth-container>

<h2>Random Findings of Note</h2>
<ul class="list">
    <li>Falodran is a very young black dragon</li>
    <li>Falodran has changed visibly since claiming Nera as part of his horde</li>
    <li>Falodran is a masculine hermaphrodite</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
    Normally Falodran prefers to wait and let his servants kill his enemies for him. However, if Falodran finds himself in battle, he will open up with a use
    of his breath weapon then charge in to the fight, relying on his natural strength and durability to survive. If a smarter "servant" is in battle with him,
    Falodran will often "consider" their advice and will never admit that he followed it because it sounded like a good idea at the time.
