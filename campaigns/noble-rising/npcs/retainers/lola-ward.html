<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Lola is 5' 5" and 133 lbs with lower back length black hair, brown eyes, D cup titties, and deeply tanned skin. She has runner's muscles
    and a form with fine curves, though she does have a burn scar on her stomach, just to the left of her belly button. Lola's typical city
    attire is a dark green shirt and leather vest with leather skirt, belt, sturdy boots, and a cloak, though she will occasionally wear a pair
    of wool gloves for warmth. She often includes a simple scarf.
</p>
<p>
	Lola's entertainer's outfit is a bright pink, long sleeve undershirt with a yellow sleeveless coat and dark purple pants with a pair of purple
    leather shoes and wide-brimmed hat with some kind of large feather sticking out of it.
</p>
<p>
	Lola's courtier's outfit is a silk and bone corset beneath a tight, blue shirt that tucks into a matching skirt, which flares out half a foot on
    either side, a short headdress with clouds and a sun embroidered into it and a pair of leather boots with stiletto heels. Both the shirt and skirt 
    have embroidery depicting dogs and cats playing. For jewelry, Lola adds several fine silver bracelets and rings with a small silver pendant that
    has a tiger eye turquoise embedded in it.
</p>

    <p>
        Lola is greedy, opportunistic and considers herself before all others, however, she will work with others when it benefits her, sometimes even for just building
        up, or maintaining, her reputation. While she doesn't particularly care for rules or laws, she does understand the value of working with people
        of higher status and will be loyal to them if she has a solid reason to (and if she eventually gains subordinates, she will expect the same from
        them).
    </p>
    <p>
        Lola is true to her word, but is loathe to give it, especially when she believes that she can't keep it or that it will severely inconvenience her.

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
    Lola prefers to skirt around the outside of combat, attacking with her bow, until she spots an opportunity to get around and behind an opponent, at which
    point she will unleash a flurry with both her shortswords. If she can get into an enemy group undetected, she will move to kill off one, or two, enemies
    before making her exit.
</p>

<h2 id="history-and-motivation">History and Motivation</h2>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm lola-history noble-full">
    <p>
        Lola started her life as a simple beggar, utilizing her status as a child in order to make enough coppers to feed herself. As she grew up, she quickly
        found that her age was making begging harder and harder, and the food she was eating worth an equally increasing price. To solve that problem, Lola turned
        to theft, sneaking into homes and businesses while the owners were away in order to steal money and food. While profitable, burglary proved to be unreliable,
        so Lola sought out a small thieves’ guild in order to get a more reliable flow of marks. When even this proved to be too little, Lola found that her beauty
        made her sought after by the wealthy and turned to being an escort/prostitute during times when marks were too few for her taste.
    </p>
    <p>
        After some time, Lola discovered the Slayer's Guild and the wealth that her skills allowed her to earn while slaying. Since then, she has worked primarily
        as a slayer, though she will go after a mark or escort a member of the upper class if the pay is good enough.
