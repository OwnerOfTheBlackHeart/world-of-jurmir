<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
	Chachick is a 9 foot tall nen warrior, resembling a cockroach
	standing on its back pair of legs. All nen extremities have 3 digits (2 fingers and a thumb for hands, 2 forward toes and 1 backward 
	toe for feet) and are typically thick and sturdy. Nen exoskeletons are both thick and durable, allowing the nen to shrug off attacks 
	as if they were wearing full body armor and survive in otherwise hostile conditions (such as deserts).
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
	Chachick has been calmed by years, if not decades, of isolation, and in this shows in her fighting style. Chachick steadily advances on her enemy,
    relying on her natural sturdiness to get her to her enemy, where she attacks with violent and brutal strikes, mixing in the use of her powers when
    it she feels the need to.
</p>
<p>
    Chachick is well aware of the mobility that her climb speed grants her and the weakness of her slow reactions, though she generally doesn't
    have the mental speed to use this information in combat, but she is quick to recognize good tactics when provided instructions by an ally.
