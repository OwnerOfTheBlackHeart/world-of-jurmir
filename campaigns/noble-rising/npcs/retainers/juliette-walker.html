    <i class="power">Battle Clarity (Ex):</i>
    Juliette can enter a state of almost mystical awareness of the battlefield around her. As long as she is not flat-footed, she gains an insight bonus equal to her
    Intelligence bonus (maximum equals her warblade level) on her Reflex saves.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Weapon Aptitude (Ex):</i>
    Juliette counts as a fighter equal to her warblade level -2 for the sake of feats. Each morning, she can spend 1 hour in weapon practice to change the designated 
    weapon for any feat she has that applies only to a single weapon (such as Weapon Focus). She must have the newly designated weapon available during her practice 
    session to make this change.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Battle Ardor (Ex):</i>
    The sheer love of battle lends uncanny strength to Juliette's blows. She gains an insight bonus equal to her Intelligence bonus on rolls made to confirm critical hits.

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Juliette is 5' 1" and 125lbs with with short blonde hair, a ponytail that reaches down to her back, blue eyes, pale to tanned skin (depending on
    how much she's been outside) and soft features, though her stare can occasionally be intense. Juliette has a typical build for a human female, though
    her arms, legs and belly are muscular.
</p>
<p>
    Juliette's typical armor is a suit of chainmail with a black overshirt (possibly dyed recently in order to improve her odds of being accepted into Nera's service)
    with a set of armor plates that protect her neck and shoulders. She carries a longsword on her left hip. When she isn't in armor, she wears a simple wool shirt and
    skirt, a sturdy leather belt, and an ample cloak with a hood. When it's colder, she will add a leather jacket.
</p>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm juliette-personality noble-full">
    <p>
        While Juliette doesn't regret her life choices, she does feel some level of guilt for leaving her family and the harm she has done as a bandit.
        Because of this, Juliette intends to use her service to one of the saviors of Mirstone as a means of atonement. Other than that, Juliette treats
        people with the respect given to her, though she can be a little on the greedy side.
    </p>
    <p>
        Juliette particularly enjoys rabbit stew, baklava, melopita (honey pie) and oral (whether giving or receiving).
    </p>
    <p>
        The one thing she won't do is whore herself out. It's not that she is unwilling to do sexual deeds, she just refuses to do so with a stranger.

<h2 id="history-and-motivation">History and Motivation</h2>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm juliette-history noble-full nera">
    <p>
        Juliette was born in Mirstone, growing up in the village and eventually becoming a guard. It didn't take her long, however, to become frustrated with
        the poor pay and lack of care the local mayor showed to his guard force. After a particularly loud fight with the mayor followed by a similar fight
        with her parents, Juliette left Mirstone, taking her few belongings and her skills with her.
    </p>
    <p>
        Shortly after leaving Mirstone, she fell in with a group of bandits that preyed on the Cherryvale/Elderfield roads, which she stayed in for roughly 2 years
        before the bandit group fell for a trap setup by the <ap-link-button linkName="noble-desserr">Desserr</ap-link-button> guard, which wiped out most 
        of that group. After that, Juliette jumped around with various small bandit groups, always seeming to know just when to need 
        (<ap-link-button linkName="noble-phidove">Phidove</ap-link-button> believes that she had an informant in the guard telling her when to run). 
    </p>
    <p>
        Juliette made a movement towards <ap-link-button linkName="noble-desserr">Desserr</ap-link-button> after a particularly narrow escape, with a small
        group of guards hot on her tail. Once in the city, Juliette managed to evade the guards pursuing her (<ap-link-button linkName="noble-phidove">Phidove</ap-link-button>
        confirms that Juliette used Nera's child network to evade capture). After her evasion of the guards, Juliette made her way to the Winking Eye and gained
        a pardon from, the then, Baroness Nera and entered her employ (<ap-link-button linkName="noble-phidove">Phidove</ap-link-button> believes that Juliette
        choose to seek pardon from Nera because of Nera's involvement with saving Mirstone from Ulath and because Nera has a reputation for treating her servants
        well).
