</p>

<p>
	<i class="power">Arcane Channeling (Su):</i> You can use a standard action to cast
	any touch spell you know and deliver the spell through your weapon with a melee attack. Casting a spell in this manner
	does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less. If the melee
	attack is successful, the attack deals damage normally; then the effect of the spell is resolved.
</p>

<p>
	<i class="power">Quick Cast (1/day):</i>
	You can cast one spell each day as a swift action, so long as the casting time of the spell is 1 standard action or less.
</p>

<p>
	<i class="power">Spell Power (Ex, +2):</i> You can more easily overcome the spell resistance of any opponent you
	successfully injure with a melee attack. If you have injured an opponent with a melee attack, you gain a +2 bonus on your
	caster level check to overcome spell resistance for the remainder of the encounter.

<h2>Random Findings of Note</h2>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	Yasrena is 5' 2" tall and 117 lbs in weight with white hair, humanlike ice-blue eyes, light coal skin, and 
	sharp features. She usually wears her hair in a large ponytail with two "strips" of hair on either side of
	her face. She typically wears a black leather shirt that leaves her flanks and upper back exposed with matching
	gloves and leggings, which others may consider sexually explicit while Yasrena considers it a show of confidence
	in herself. When travelling or expecting danger, Yasrena adds a pair of metal gauntlets and metal heeled boots.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
	In combat, Yasrena likes to start fights at a range, using her spells to create an initial advantage and act as
	artillery against her enemies. Once she is satisfied with the amount of damage she has dealt to her enemies,
	Yasrena will dive in to finish off her enemies with her enchanted bloodstone blade.
</p>
<p>
	If her enemies engage Yasrena before she has a chance to cast her spells, she will fight with her sword and melee
	spells (if she has them prepared).
</p>

<h2>History and Motivation</h2>
<p>
	Yasrena was born underground in the drow city of Amnoranis (beautiful guide) with purple eyes. She was born into
	a relatively low birth, taking up the sword as a means of sustaining herself. As she served her superior drowesses,
	Yasrena founder herself slowly being drawn to the Sister of Sithrak, Kriotz, much to the distaste of those around
	her.
</p>
<p>
	Eventually, Yasrena found that she was no longer welcome among the drow and left before they could have a chance
	to sacrifice her to the magics that seal the void. Following the visions given to her by Kriotz, Yasrena escaped
	to the surface, where she now roams from place to place while carefully avoiding settlements.
</p>
<p>
	She now seeks knowledge and magic, on a pilgrimage to ancient ruins and holy sites of Kriotz. Yasrena is also
	looking for tools with which to protect her from those drow houses who might still hunt her. Eventually, she
	would like to find a place that she could safely settle down and worship the Goddess of Knowledge and Magic.
