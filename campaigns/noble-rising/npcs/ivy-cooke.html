	<p>
		<i class="power">Arcane Channeling (Su):</i> You can use a standard action to cast
		any touch spell you know and deliver the spell through your weapon with a melee attack. Casting a spell in this manner
		does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less. If the melee
		attack is successful, the attack deals damage normally; then the effect of the spell is resolved.
	</p>

	<p>
		<i class="power">Quick Cast (1/day):</i>
		You can cast one spell each day as a swift action, so long as the casting time of the spell is 1 standard action or less.
	</p>

	<p>
		<i class="power">Spell Power (Ex, +2):</i> You can more easily overcome the spell resistance of any opponent you
		successfully injure with a melee attack. If you have injured an opponent with a melee attack, you gain a +2 bonus on your
		caster level check to overcome spell resistance for the remainder of the encounter.

			<li>

<h2>Gifts exchanged</h2>
<ul class="list">
	<li>Ivy has given Nera 2 human slaves/whores</li>
	<li>Nera has given Ivy a weeping flask (CM 135)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	Ivy is 5' 7" tall and 141 lbs in weight with shoulder length, white hair, dark blue eyes, pale skin, and dark red
	lips. She has two ram-like horns that protrude from her head that she tips with gold covers as ornamentation. When
	not disguised, Ivy typically wears her bluish-purple mithral breastplate with decorative leather pauldrons and skirt,
	and matching silk robes underneath.
</p>
<p>
	When actually in a place where she feels safe and not in disguise, Ivy wears a dark purple silk dress with gold and
	silver woven into it so finely that from a distance the whole dress appears to sparkle.
</p>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm ivy-cooke-disguise noble-full">
	<p>
		When in disguise, Ivy wears a hooded Cloak of Nondetection (DC 17) and a Ring of Alter Self. She appears as a 5' 2"
		tall, thin, elven woman with deep brown hair (matching Ivy's style) and deep purple eyes. Her disguise wears green
		robes that tightly hug her form. The name of her disguise is Victaella Duskwalker, a servant of Countess Vonesti 
		Hunitheplithym.
	</p>
</ap-auth-container>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
	Ivy prefers to choose when and where fights begin, and will usually attack from surprise, mixing her sneak attack
	and her quickened spells to make for as quick a kill as possible. If she is able to quickly flee after dropping an
	opponent, she will do so and try to draw her opponents into another trap.
</p>
<p>
	When Ivy has backup, she will stay back until the enemy has engaged her allies, before diving in with spell and blade
	to attack where the enemy is weakest. She will usually try to pick off of the smallest and weakest enemies first,
	letting her allies focus on the heavier and more dangerous opponents.
</p>
<p>
	Regardless of if she is fighting with backup, Ivy attempts to flee any fight that leaves her at half, or less, health.

<h2>History and Motivation</h2>
	<p>
		Ivy was born in <ap-link-button linkName="noble-deathfall">Deathfall Village</ap-link-button> and quickly fell into the
		wrong crowd on account of her horns exposing themselves. At first she served as an enforcer before the last of house
		Hunitheplithym took her in as a means to replace their lost daughter. They taught Ivy how to use the ancient arts of the
		Duskblade, meanwhile Ivy was also learning how to rob, steal and lie from right under her adoptive parents' noses. After they
		learned of her stealing from them, Ivy killed the last of house Hunitheplithym, taking the name that her adoptive parents
		gave her as an alias for attempting to take over Deathfall.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ivy seeks to use the claim of House Hunitheplithym to take control of Deathfall and operate "enterprises" out of the village
		for a fee. Ivy has no issue with worshippers of the Red King, as she believes that his coming will not interfere with her
		and her plans.
