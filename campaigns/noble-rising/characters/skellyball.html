<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	Skellyball is a 25lbs, 5' 6" tall, male, human skeleton that can compress into a ball roughly the size of a basketball. When
	controlled by a dread necromancer a skellyball gains black fire in their eyes.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
	Skellyball fights as ordered to, which is typically by chattering up to his target and clawing them with his razor
	sharp claws. Skellyball gains a new <ap-link-button linkName="noble-skellyball-powers">power</ap-link-button> every odd level
	and every 4th level, he gains 3 ability score points to distribute as wanted.
</p>
<p>
	Skellyball can wear light armor, a light shield, and a light weapon before he can no longer roll into a ball.
</p>

<h2>History and Motivation</h2>
<p>
	Skellyball is a skeleton that was turned into a magic item by a lost necromancer, which was then stolen from the
	necromancer by a polar bear. He is motivated by whomever currently has him commanded. In the hands of a dread
	necromancer, he becomes something more than just a normal skeleton.
