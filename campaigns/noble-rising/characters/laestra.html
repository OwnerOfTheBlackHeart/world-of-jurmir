<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Laestra is a 5' 5" tall drow female with straight, ankle length, silver hair, B cup titties, coal black skin, a muscular build (for a drow),
    and a hateful gaze coming from two pure white eyes. In areas that see more sun, such as Laestra's face, the color lightens, up to a chalky gray.
</p>
<p>
    Laestra is currently clad in a sleeved, sack cloth dress which covers all but her feet, which are wrapped in cloth "shoes," and head. It is clear
    that this dress is uncomfortable.

<h2 id="history-and-motivation">History and Motivation</h2>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm laestra-history noble-full nera">
    <p>
        Laestra was born in <ap-link-button linkName="noble-methnaes">Methnaes</ap-link-button> among the population of "surface drow." For the most part,
        she lived a relatively normal childhood, commanding over males and being taught the ins and outs of being a matron of her home. She even joined
        the <ap-link-button linkName="noble-methnaes">Methnaes</ap-link-button> army and participated in the early 
        <ap-link-button linkName="noble-hamahakki">Hamahakki</ap-link-button> hunts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Laestra ended up being the only survivor of a <ap-link-button linkName="noble-hamahakki">Hamahakki</ap-link-button> hunt, having been close enough
        to the entrance of the cave the hunt was in to have not been caught in <ap-link-button linkName="noble-hamahakki">Hamahakki</ap-link-button>'s webs.
        At first, this hunt had terrified Laestra, but with every hunt there after, of <ap-link-button linkName="noble-hamahakki">Hamahakki</ap-link-button>
        or her cults, Laestra felt drawn further towards the goddess of venomous spiders.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the day Laestra's tour of duty was complete, she walked out to the cave where she encountered 
        <ap-link-button linkName="noble-hamahakki">Hamahakki</ap-link-button> and called out to the goddess, who responded. Laestra's memory of the response,
        and several hours afterwards, are blurry at best, but she walked out of that cave a cleric devoted to
        <ap-link-button linkName="noble-hamahakki">Hamahakki</ap-link-button>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Freshly anointed as a possessor of the voice of <ap-link-button linkName="noble-hamahakki">Hamahakki</ap-link-button>, Laestra marched to the nearest
        settlement to the cave and settled down, forming a new cult that managed to avoid notice for nearly 30 years. However, it was found and hunted.
        While Laestra managed to avoid being caught for almost another decade, the <ap-link-button linkName="noble-methnaes">Methnaes</ap-link-button> army
        caught up to her and managed to capture her.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thanks to the <ap-link-button linkName="noble-nera-methnaes-agreement">deal</ap-link-button> 
        that Nera made with Duchess <ap-link-button linkName="noble-methnaes" hash="eclavna-ichiir">Ichiir</ap-link-button>, Laestra was
        spared from the headsman's block, and instead sent to serve Nera as a slave. Laestra believes that she was chosen to do so in the hopes that her
        presence in <ap-link-button linkName="noble-taaira-ruzara">Taaira Ruzara</ap-link-button> will cause an outbreak of worshipers that would, in turn,
        draw <ap-link-button linkName="noble-hamahakki">Hamahakki</ap-link-button> away from <ap-link-button linkName="noble-methnaes">Methnaes</ap-link-button>.
