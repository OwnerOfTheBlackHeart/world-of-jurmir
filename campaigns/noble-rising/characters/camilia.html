<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Camilia is 4' 11" tall and 115 lbs in weight with back length black hair, purple eyes, tanned skin, and rounded features.
    She has a perfect mix of muscle and fat that make her appear as almost the perfect female form with three
    claw mark scars: one on her upper right arm, near the shoulder, at the base of her back, and on her left leg.
    She wears two sewn rabbit hides as a braw and a knee-length deer hide skirt that is open on her right side.
    Camilia is 19 years old.
</p>
<p>
	Camilia also has a suit of hide armor made from a mutated dire wolf. This armor is a silky black hide that covers Camilia's
	front and back down to her knees, like a poncho, leaving her sides, arms and legs exposed, with the head of the dire wolf
	forming a hood. Covering her feet are boots made from the same hide.
</p>
<p>
	Camilia's court outfit is a white, shoulder-less dress that goes down to her ankles, hugs her form, and shows off half cleavage,
	with padded socks that have a soft wood sole and rise to her thighs and white gloves that go to mid bicep. For jewelry, she wears
	a puka shell choker, pearl stud earings, and shaped obsidian rings.
</p>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm camilia-personality noble-full">
    <p>
        Camilia is generally curious about the world around her, seeking to learn new ways to exploit it to her own ends.
        When confused, she will generally look to her guide, Nera, for advice and direction on what is happening/being said.
        Camilia is unfamiliar with most common phrases, needing some translation to equivalent gnollish phrases.

</ul>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
    Camilia generally prefers to stay out of combat, using her bow to pick off farther targets and tag escaping
    enemies. When all the enemies are in melee with her allies she will move to support her allies by either 
    buffing her allies with spells or buffing herself and joining the melee.
</p>

<h2>History and Motivation</h2>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm camilia-history noble-full">
    <p>
        Camilia was born in the gnoll lands beyond the southern mountains of Taaira-Ruzara, where gnolls are the
        dominant race that have forced humans and elves to live in small, nomadic tribes. In the meetings with
        other tribes, friendly gnolls, and elvish tribes Camilia heard of lands beyond the mountains that promised
        wealth and power to those that sought them and quickly found herself leaving her tribe to find a better
        life for herself, tribe be damned.
    </p>
    <p>
        Back in her tribe, Camilia was being groomed and instructed to become a druid shaman. After gaining her
        druidic powers, she served as a midwife and a hunter until she left.
    </p>
    <p>
        After arriving in Taaira-Ruzara, she wandered from settlement to settlement until she reached Desserr, where
        she met Nera and was quickly recruited via "generosity." Camilia is now part of a blood pact with Nera.
    </p>
</ap-auth-container>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm camilia-motivation noble-full">
    <p>
        Camilia has formed a blood pact, a magical contract, with Nera where in exchange for food, housing, and guidance
        around the civilized world, Camilia will guard and aid Nera. Should Nera wish it, she may command Camilia to
        mate.
    </p>
    <p>
        Camilia partially came to Taaira-Ruzara to seek a better life for herself, but also to seek out the hero
        of the next cycle. The elven elders told her of the cycles in many stories of the rising of activity in
        monsters and disreputable sorts shortly before a hero rises to slay them and take control of the land,
        creating peace and stability. One also told Camilia that she would find this cycle's hero in a person whose
        true nature was masked in black robes.
