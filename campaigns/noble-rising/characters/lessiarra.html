<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Lessiarra is a 19' tall and 3.2 ton female "tigerfolk" with "F (DDD)" cup titties, a sturdy build and a state perpetual happiness.
    Lessiarra normally wears a light brown-gray garment resembling a shirt with elbow length sleeves and exposed shoulders with a
    matching skirt that drapes down to her mid-shins, though the whole outfit looks like a dress unless one looks closely.
    When travelling through terrain that might damage the skirt, she'll swap out the skirt for leather shorts or pants, depending on
    the season.
</p>

<h2 id="random-findings">Random Findings of Note</h2>
<ul class="list">
    <li>Lessiarra was gifted to Nera by <ap-link-button linkName="noble-desserr-nobility" hash="diha-raging-wolf">Countess Diha Raging Wolf</ap-link-button></li>
    <li>Lessiarra likes hugs, even if she has to pick up the huggee</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
    Lessiarra generally doesn't like to fight, as it makes her worry about all the "cute little babies," but when she has to fight,
    Lessiarra softens up enemy units with her siege bow before charging in with whatever vaguely club like object she can find. While in
    melee, she likes to keep her distance and use her natural reach to limit the retaliation ability of her opponents, or to reach
    past her allies and crush oncoming enemies.
</p>
<p>
    If too much harm comes to her "cute little babies," Lessiarra will suddenly become silent and stoic, focusing entirely on destroying
    whatever threatens her allies. This stoic state is mechanically her barbarian rage.
</p>

<h2 id="history-and-motivation">History and Motivation</h2>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm lessiarra-history noble-full">
    <p>
        Born as a tribal catfolk among the forests of what is now <ap-link-button linkName="noble-rivers-pass">Rivers Pass</ap-link-button>,
        Lessiarra was among the many of her kin who protected her tribe from wild animals and other tribes, what some might call barbarians.
    </p>
    <p>
        After the reorganization of <ap-link-button linkName="noble-taaira-ruzara">Taaira Ruzara</ap-link-button> into a duchy, Lessiarra's tribe
        came into conflict with the, then under construction, <ap-link-button linkName="noble-new-castle">New Castle</ap-link-button>. After
        <ap-link-button linkName="noble-desserr-nobility" hash="diha-raging-wolf">Countess Diha Raging Wolf</ap-link-button> pulled together
        a force of her own soldiers and hired mercenaries, she was able to force Lessiarra's tribe to the negotiation table. As part of the agreement,
        Lessiarra was turned over to <ap-link-button linkName="noble-desserr-nobility" hash="diha-raging-wolf">Diha</ap-link-button>.
    </p>
    <p>
        After acquiring Lessiarra, <ap-link-button linkName="noble-desserr-nobility" hash="diha-raging-wolf">Diha</ap-link-button> took her to
        <ap-link-button linkName="noble-zigni">Zigni</ap-link-button>, who was able to bring the 7' 9" tall catfolk up to 14 feet tall. While
        <ap-link-button linkName="noble-desserr-nobility" hash="diha-raging-wolf">Diha</ap-link-button> was pleased with this, she wanted Lessiarra
        to be even more of a giant and tasked a small cabal of alchemists and wizards to accomplish the task. Needless to say, they succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
        With Lessiarra brought to a size that <ap-link-button linkName="noble-desserr-nobility" hash="diha-raging-wolf">Diha</ap-link-button> was happy with,
        she left the massive catfolk at <ap-link-button linkName="noble-blackhide">Blackhide</ap-link-button> to wait for Nera.

        A "casualty" of her tribe's "loss," Lessiarra is currently at a loss of what to do with herself, though she does worry that if she doesn't do
        what the "victors" want of her that her tribe may be in danger.
