<h2>General Story Notes</h2>
<ul class="list">
	<li>
		The court wizard maintains power by making the land ready for a hero,
		then taking control of the hero after they become the ruler.
		<ul>
			<li>The court wizard goes by the name Voczec Beliah</li>
			<li>He is actually minor god by the name of Cezvoc (sez voc)</li>
			<li>
				Cezvoc is a god of monsters, conflict and dark magic who is worshiped in an
				attempt to appease him. He is worshiped with public displays of conflict, with
				the most sacred ritual being lethal combat against monsters. His symbol is an
				axe and a spear crossed over each other.
			</li>
			<li>
				A small village worshipes Cezvoc. The village has a simple dug pit with logs
				to strengthen the walls that serves as the colosseum that the sacred combat
				happens in. A rope ladder that is dropped when the rituals are complete is
				the only means of exiting teh colosseum. Due to the colosseum, the village
				has an abnormal number of warriors.
