<h1>The Goblin Party</h1>
<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>
	After the party visits the nymph <ap-link-button linkName="noble-neras-captured" hash="anithea">Anithea</ap-link-button>, she will speak to Elizabeth 
    and ask her to deal with some goblins that she's seen around. She doesn't believe them to be an immediate threat, but their continued existence could
    cause problems.

	<li>The party brings Elizabeth to <ap-link-button linkName="noble-neras-captured" hash="anithea">Anithea</ap-link-button> (022.015).</li>
    <li>
        The first party member to approach <ap-link-button linkName="noble-neras-captured" hash="anithea">Anithea</ap-link-button> must make a DC 20 Reflex Save or 
        fall on their ass and slide down to the water's edge. From the water's edge, a small mound covered in slippery mud can be seen, but the mound is invisible 
        to those on the other side of it.

	<li>
		<ap-link-button linkName="noble-neras-captured" hash="anithea">Anithea</ap-link-button> speaks to Elizabeth in Voidspeak:
		<ul class="list">
			<li><ap-link-button linkName="noble-neras-captured" hash="anithea">Anithea</ap-link-button> will refer to Elizabeth as cousin.</li>
            <li>
                <ap-link-button linkName="noble-neras-captured" hash="anithea">Anithea</ap-link-button> calls the

            <li>
                <ap-link-button linkName="noble-neras-captured" hash="anithea">Anithea</ap-link-button> has been watching a "slayer party" made up of goblinoids.
                 She doesn't believe that she can handle the party on her own.
            </li>
            <li>
                <ap-link-button linkName="noble-neras-captured" hash="anithea">Anithea</ap-link-button> is unsure of why the goblin party has formed, but she 
                suspects they might be some kind of advanced force.
            </li>
            <li>She's using an enchanted crystal ball that a wizard lost.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
    <li>
        Information <ap-link-button linkName="noble-neras-captured" hash="anithea">Anithea</ap-link-button> will say in common:
        <ul class="list">
            <li>This is her pond. She will see it become lively again.</li>
            <li>She would like more space where she could grow a small grove.</li>
            <li>She will to help restore the soil if given tree and flower seeds for her grove.</li>
            <li>If minion is there, she'll tell him to go drown in the river, then wake up.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
	<li>
		The Party begins searching for the goblin party. 
		<ul class="list">
			<li>Gather Information DC 10 - Hobgoblins are militaristic and all goblins are hostile to non-goblinoids.</li>
			<li>Gather Information DC 13 - Traders have been disappearing around [[location]].</li>
			<li>Gather Information DC 15 - A heavily armored hobgoblin was spotted at [[location]], guarding a stone tower in the middle of a road.</li>
			<li>Gather Information DC 17 - A stone tower has been seen moving along the roads at [[location]], stopping and attacking anyone it comes across.</li>
			<li>
                Gather Information DC 20 - A hobgoblin kingdom has formed in the desert north of the Craglorn Mountains, where they wage war with the blue dragons 
                inhabiting the desert.
            </li>
            <li>
                Knowledge (geography) DC 10 and Knowledge (nature) DC 10 - The party would have to be located in a forest away from both elves and logging operations
                in order to be both undetected and sufficiently fed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Knowledge (geography) DC 12 and Knowledge (nature) DC 13 - The best location for the party would probably be [[location]], but other viable locations
                include [[location]], [[location]] and [[location]].
            </li>
            <li>
                Knowledge (geography) DC 15, Knowledge (nature) DC 13, and Gather Information DC 15 - Cross referencing viable locations for a goblinoid party to go undetected,
                movement of local game animals, and various other signs picked up by hunters and explorers, the most likely location for the party would be [[location]].
            </li>
            <li>For 280gp, the party can hire a wizard to do cast scrying. If the party goes to Voczec, he will charge 300gp if they don't have Nera and only 200gp if they do.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
    <li>The party summons the goblin tower.</li>
    <li>The party fights the goblin party.</li>
    <li>
        The party investigates the goblin tower.
        <ul class="list">
            <li>
                The tower itself is a 9 story tall, stone tower with small, metal barred windows. The exterior of the tower is poorly cared for, with vines
                covering the stonework and stains, chips and divots marring the stone itself. The front door of the tower is heavy and reinforced.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>1st Floor:</b> This floor is dedicated to a "stables" with both worgs and goblins in cages, many of which have clearly been abused. A small defensive
                force guards this location, relying on fire trap (10d6, DC 18 for half) and a log trap (6d8, DC 21 to avoid damage) to weaken stronger opponents.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>2nd Floor:</b> This floor is cleaner than the rest with a washing tub and brushes of several types. Discarded thick, black fur covers almost
                as if a carpet. A figure 8 track goes about the floor, filled with sand and clearly well used.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>3rd Floor:</b> While not as disgusting as other floors, this floor is a mess. Almost a foot of dirt covers the floor with random mosses, mushrooms,
                grasses and shrubs growing within it. Lice covered hides of both animals and humanoids are scattered about, mostly focused around a tanning rack and
                meat hook. A pair of archery targets are the only well kept items within the floor.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>4th Floor:</b> This floor is covered in dust and smells of rotting food. Filling the floor is a "collection" of random paintings, statuettes,
                pieces of jewelry, broken tools and seemingly whatever its prior occupant decided was worth picking up. Used dishes and half-eaten food are hidden
                about the room. The contents of this floor are worth 4,000 gold.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>5th Floor:</b> While this floor has a bed and a small dresser, it looks like a gladiator's training area with a sand covered "field" with practice
                dummies and spare weapons (tridents, spears, clubs, swords, etc.). The spare armor and weapons in this floor can be sold for 300 gold.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>6th Floor:</b> This floor is covered in dust and a grease-like film (which is blood and skin and such left over from 
                <ap-link-button linkName="noble-verdak">Verdak's</ap-link-button> experiments). A pair of bookshelves contain works (in disgusting condition) covering
                subjects from martial arts to anatomy to the transmutation of living creatures.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>7th Floor:</b> This floor has a rusty oven, a spit and plentiful unwashed cookware along with a "pantry" that holds various meats and vegetables,
                most of which are at least partially rotten. A few pickling jars are present, but they are far from the majority of the food.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>8th Floor:</b> This floor is clear save for a simple altar covered in blood. Sitting atop the altar is an avatar of
                <ap-link-button linkName="noble-liberation-guild">Vano</ap-link-button>. Once the party enters the room, he will say "A contract made is a contract kept"
                before summoning a bone devil and blowing away like sand.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>9th Floor:</b> This floor is a laboratory of some kind, with multiple different means of restraining "subjects," bloody instruments, books
                filled with hastily scribbled goblin (mostly <ap-link-button linkName="noble-verdak">Verdak's</ap-link-button> observations of the effects of
                spells on living targets), and half-assed attempts at creating usable measuring tools. Several deceased subjects remain shackled to walls and
                tables.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>9th Floor:</b> This floor is the open roof of the tower. Here, where one has a reprieve from the stink and filth of the tower, is a sitting area
                with poorly made tables and chairs.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
	<li>The party returns to <ap-link-button linkName="noble-neras-captured" hash="anithea">Anithea</ap-link-button> (022.015).</li>
