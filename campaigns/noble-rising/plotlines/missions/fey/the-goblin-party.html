<h1>The Goblin Party</h1>
<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>
	After the party visits the nymph <ap-link-button linkName="noble-neras-captured" hash="anithea">Anithea</ap-link-button>, she will speak to Elizabeth 
    and ask her to deal with some goblins that she's seen around. She doesn't believe them to be an immediate threat, but their continued existence could
    cause problems.

	<li>The party brings Elizabeth to <ap-link-button linkName="noble-neras-captured" hash="anithea">Anithea</ap-link-button> (022.015).</li>
    <li>
        The first party member to approach <ap-link-button linkName="noble-neras-captured" hash="anithea">Anithea</ap-link-button> must make a DC 20 Reflex Save or 
        fall on their ass and slide down to the water's edge. From the water's edge, a small mound covered in slippery mud can be seen, but the mound is invisible 
        to those on the other side of it.

                <ap-link-button linkName="noble-neras-captured" hash="anithea">Anithea</ap-link-button> is unsure of why the goblin party has formed, but she

		The Party begins searching for the goblin party. 
		<ul class="list">
			<li>Gather Information DC 10 - Hobgoblins are militaristic and all goblins are hostile to non-goblinoids.</li>
			<li>Gather Information DC 13 - Traders have been disappearing around [[location]].</li>
			<li>Gather Information DC 15 - A heavily armored hobgoblin was spotted at [[location]], guarding a stone tower in the middle of a road.</li>
			<li>Gather Information DC 17 - A stone tower has been seen moving along the roads at [[location]], stopping and attacking anyone it comes across.</li>
			<li>
                Gather Information DC 20 - A hobgoblin kingdom has formed in the desert north of the Craglorn Mountains, where they wage war with the blue dragons 
                inhabiting the desert.
            </li>
            <li>
                Knowledge (geography) DC 10 and Knowledge (nature) DC 10 - The party would have to be located in a forest away from both elves and logging operations
                in order to be both undetected and sufficiently fed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Knowledge (geography) DC 12 and Knowledge (nature) DC 13 - The best location for the party would probably be [[location]], but other viable locations
                include [[location]], [[location]] and [[location]].
            </li>
            <li>
                Knowledge (geography) DC 15, Knowledge (nature) DC 13, and Gather Information DC 15 - Cross referencing viable locations for a goblinoid party to go undetected,
                movement of local game animals, and various other signs picked up by hunters and explorers, the most likely location for the party would be [[location]].
            </li>
            <li>For 280gp, the party can hire a wizard to do cast scrying. If the party goes to Voczec, he will charge 300gp if they don't have Nera and only 200gp if they do.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
    <li>The party travels to [[location]].</li>
    <li>The party fights the goblin party.</li>
	<li>The party returns to <ap-link-button linkName="noble-neras-captured" hash="anithea">Anithea</ap-link-button> (022.015).</li>
