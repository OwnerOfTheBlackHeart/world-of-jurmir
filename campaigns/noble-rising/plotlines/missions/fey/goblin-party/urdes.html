<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
	The scarred goblin is hidden, crouched in the brush of the forest with a malevolent gaze and a drawn crossbow. Beneath the cloak of the ugly humanoid rests
    a small horde of potions and a morningstar.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
	Urdes likes to fight from 40 to 50 feet away, attacking from within the trees or while hidden in the underbrush. He will use his crossbow for as long as he can,
    but if the enemy gets close and looks weak, he'll attack with his morningstar. Otherwise, he'll run through a variable field of traps (typically 20 foot pit traps)
    in order to escape or gain the advantage.
