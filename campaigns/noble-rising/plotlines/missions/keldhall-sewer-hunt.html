<h1>Keldhall Sewer Hunt</h1>
<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>
	After some light investigation in the town of <ap-link-button linkName="noble-keldhall">Keldhall</ap-link-button>, Sin has decided
    to begin hunting in the sewers. The information that she received was that the town has a cult in the sewers.

<h2 id="outline">General Outline</h2>
<ol>
	<li>
		Sin investigates the sewers:
		<ul class="list">
			<li>The only signs of goblins are the occasional piece of reused trash.</li>
            <li>There is a 1 in 10 (1) chance 1d3 goblins will attack Sin during an exploration turn.</li>
            <li>There is a 1 in 10 (10) chance that Sin will stumble onto the cult.</li>
            <li>
                Each turn, Sin can roll a Knowledge (religion) check (DC 17), a gather information check (DC 17) or a track roll to find the cult.
            </li>
		</ul>
	</li>
    <li>
        Sin finds the cult base:
        <ul class="list">
            <li>The entrance is a hole, roughly the size of a mineshaft, carved through the side wall of the sewers and covered over with a rotting wooden door.</li>
            <li>The entrance tunnel is made of dirt reinforced with hay and clay with a small, open lead pipe through which a stream of sewer water flows.</li>
            <li>
                The door is guarded by:
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>CR 3</li>
                    <li>1 <ap-link-button linkName="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/troglodyte.htm">Troglodyte</ap-link-button> - CR 1</li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If approached peacefully, the guard will ask if the party has come to join those who have been thrown away.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        The party enters the cult base:
        <ul class="list">
            <li>
                If entering peacefully, the party will be taken to meet with the priest of the cult. The priest will ask the party why they have come and if they try
                to convince him that they would like to join, he will make them drink sewer water. Drinkers may become infected with
                <ap-link-button linkName="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#tableDiseases">filth fever</ap-link-button> and are affected by a poison equivalent
                to <ap-link-button linkName="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#tablePoisons">Sassone leaf residue</ap-link-button>.
