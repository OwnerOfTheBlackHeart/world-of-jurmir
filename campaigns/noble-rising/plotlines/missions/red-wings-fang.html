<h1>Red Wing's Fang</h1>
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>
	Kali and his assigned army have been sent to acquire more kobolds for invasive experimentation. He has with him
	Austen Austinson (minion) and the two kobolds Arta and Vom. He has chosen to seek out the Strongwald clan as his
	source of kobolds and for knowledge of how and why they killed a dragon.
</p>
<!--
	They require the weapon Red Wing's Fang, a magic longsword currently residing in Baytide's magic weapon vault.
	Red Wing's Fang is needed for a ritual to Kyranious that the Strongwald kobolds believe will grant them even more
	of Kyranious's blessing, aka granting the clan more clerics and favored souls.

<h2>General Outline</h2>
<ol>
	<li>
		Arrive at the Strongwald Clan's trapped entrance.
		<ul class="list">
			<li>
				If the party approaches with caution and attempts to get the attention of the hidden defenders,
				then a kobold will appear behind them from a side room. If they are able to convince the kobold,
				which should be easy, then the kobold will take them to the side room and bring them up through
				the trapdoor in the ceiling.
			</li>
			<li>If the party searches for the back entrance, it is a DC 25 spot check to find it</li>
			<li>
				If within range for the spell, locate object cast to find the back entrance or secret door will
				point the party to three boulders.
			</li>

		The party meats with the important members of the kobold clan
		<ul class="list">
			<li>
				Party talks to All-Watcher Sorpo (female)
				<ul class="list">
					<li>
						Sorpo would like to help with Kali's research, however all the kobolds currently have tasks
						they are working on
					</li>
					<li>Sorpo will need a guarantee that his clan will get the researched ritual(s), likely a contract</li>
					<li>
						Sorpo will state that the High Priest, Tiro, has requested the use of 12 kobolds and that if
						his task is completed, then Sorpo can release the kobolds to Kali's experiments
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Party talks to Loremaster Dag (male)
				<ul class="list">
					<li>
						Dag is happy to tell about how Kyranious chose the Strongwald clan to perform two great tasks:<br/>
						To guard her personal horde on the material plane and to cleanse the local area of false dragons
					</li>
					<li>
						If asked about the Heretic Dragon, then Dag will mention that after the defeat of the red dragon Bryndrys,
						the blue dragon warband was the undisputed rulers of everything north of the Howling Peaks and some of the
						dragons let that position go to their head, namely the Heretic Dragons Chuzzit The Jealous (masculine herm) 
						and his mate Geldrunis The Clever (also male).<br/><br/>

						The two dragons attempted to start by demanding their hordes be lined with the clan's treasure and when the
						kobolds of Strongwald stated that their treasure belonged only to Kyranious, the two dragons threatened the
						clan. That night, the kobolds sent out a force of 6 scouts, 4 mounted warriors, 3 priests and 3 sorcerers to
						find the dragons' lair, they returned that day having only seen that the pair of dragons was moving towards
						the burrow.<br/><br/>

						Using the spells disintegrate and shape stone, the kobolds created an entrance large enough for both dragons
						to enter and posted 2 kobolds out front of it. When Chuzzit and Geldrunis landed, the kobolds told them that
						the clan decided to ask forgiveness and has moved their treasure within the newly created entrance. When the
						dragons entered, there was no treasure and the kobolds destroyed the pillars holding up several rock falls.
						When the rocks fell, they pinned the dragons by their wings and the kobolds descended upon them from every
						angle in order to kill them.<br/><br/>

						After killing Chuzzit and Geldrunis, every jem, coin, and treasure embedded in their hides were removed and
						taken to Kyranious's horde and the two dragons' pelts were turned into armor and given to the kobolds who
						showed the most bravery, prowess, and tactical creativity in the battle. Of the armor suits made, 2 have
						been enchanted and added to the horde and 3 remain being passed down from great hunter to great hunter.
					</li>
					<li>
						There is also a mural that depicts 4 kobolds (Gett (male), Kilpi (female), Ilgo (female) and Nultu (female))
						burning down a forest with 6 hydras in it. The 4 kobolds had found a den of hydras and rather than fighting
						the hydras directly, the kobolds drew the creatures into a forest that had been facing a drought and lit the
						forest on fire to kill them.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Talks to High Priest Tiro (male)
				<ul class="list">
					<li>
						Tiro will happily tell the party that the Strongwald clan is one of the chosen clans of Kyranious, each of which
						looks over and protects portions of her personal horde. A portion of this duty is hunting down fake dragons.
					</li>
					<li>
						If asked about his request for 12 kobolds, Trio will explain that a weapon, Red Wing's Fang, has been located by
						the Strongwald clan and that the weapon could empower a ritual to garner further favor with Kyranious. He will
						explain that it is located within a vault in Baytide.
						<ul class="list">
							<li>
								If asked about Red Wing's Fang, Tiro will describe it as a longsword made of pure dragon bone with glowing red
								runes across the blade
							</li>
							<li>
								If asked about the history of Red Wing's Fang, Tiro will reveal that it was made by a dwarf who found the
								still warm corpse of Bryndrys. This dwarf, whose name Tiro does not know, hollowed out the chest of Brydrys
								and used his bones and scales to create a workshop where he carved down Bryndrys's largest fang into a sword
								and then made stain from the dragon's blood and engraved the bone sword with the blood stain. After its 
								creation, Tiro doesn't know what happened to it.
