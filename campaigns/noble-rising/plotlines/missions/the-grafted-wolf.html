<h1>The Grafted Wolf</h1>
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>
	The Teamsters' and Porters' Economic Alliance of Taaria Ruzara has posted a stone grade
	job, with the following message:
</p>
<p>
	Dear slayers,<br/>
	&emsp;Several members of the Alliance have reported spotting or being attacked by some odd
	wolf. Most have described it as being scaled, but due to the fact that the majority of them have
	done so while quite drunk, it may just be a single tale spreading among "concerned" drunkards.
	I have placed a 500 gold reward for this quest's completion.<br/><br/>
	Sincerely,<br/>
	Lyla Hunter, Secretary at the Alliance Hall
</p>
