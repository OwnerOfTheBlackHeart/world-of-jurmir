<h1>Finding the Lizard Cult in Desserr</h1>
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>
	A cult worshipping the troglodyte god Ulath has formed within the sewers of
	Desserr. This cult must be found and killed off before it can become a problem
	to the city as a whole. If the party ignores this problem, the cult will kidnap
	a noble's child and an adamantine grade slayer will be dispatched.
