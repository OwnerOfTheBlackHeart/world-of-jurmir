<h1>Finding the Lizard Cult in Desserr</h1>
<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>
    A scouting company from the county/duchy Methnaes has been spotted by Sariel Naelio several times, which, along with the arrival of the 
    Ravens Company of the Empress's Army, has made her curious as to the coming events. She has decided that she should seek out the 3 commanding
    officers to find out why each group is here and what they are doing.
</p>

<h2>Letter to Nera</h2>
<p>
	Dear Lady Nera Black,<br/>
	&emsp; I am Captain Alar Bani, representing Countess Eclavna Ichiir, and you're orcess has informed me of your status as heiress to the County of Taaira Ruzara.
	I'm sure we both know that Taaira Ruzara is in decline, and with Count Zesharr handling the situation so poorly, Countess Ichiir believes that Taaira Ruzara
	is in need of new leadership. As her representative in the region, I would like to meet with you and discuss the possibility of accelerating your ascension
	to Countesshood.
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		The party talks to the two known commanding officers:
		<ul class="list">
			<li>
                Taaira Ruzara is commanded by General Thessana Marching Tree:
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Female pantherfolk, pretty 7</li>
                    <li>8th level fighter with +1 full plate, +1 heavy steel shield, +1 battleaxe, mwk longbow, and 4,900gp on hand</li>
                    <li>
                        Thessana is currently dealing with a <ap-link-button linkName="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/digester.htm">digester</ap-link-button> that 
                        has been attacking her troops when they travel too far from Desserr.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Thessana has only recently heard of Methnaes troops in the area, but doesn't consider them a threat. They won't act without legal authorization,
                        which they don't have. She doesn't consider the idea of Countess/Duchess Ichiir getting authorization for war currently possible, seeing as she
                        has seen more lyrnan troops moving about.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Thessana believes that the lyrnans are preparing for a full invasion of Taaira Ruzara.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                The Ravens Company is commanded by Captain Aglos Stalkingwolf:
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Male elf, pretty 8</li>
                    <li>5th level fighter</li>
                    <li>Full plate, heavy steel shield, mwk longsword, mwk longbow, 2,150gp on hand</li>
                    <li>
                        He is in the area to monitor the situation and report/prevent fighting from happening. 
                        Neither county has been officially authorized to wage war with the other.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        He knows that Countess/Duchess Ichiir won't make a move without authorization, but he believes that her constant scouting means that she is actively
                        looking for military targets, local allies, weak loyalties, and reasons for an invasion. He believes that if her scouts find valid reasons for invasion,
                        then war is inevitable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        DC 18 diplomacy: He is also in the area because there have been reports of humans using magic and the Hands of Kriotz inquisitors needed a front to
                        work from.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                An old friend of Sariel's, Sergeant Gorga Thigh Crusher:
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>She is the second in command to Captain Aglos Stalkingwolf</li>
                    <li>Feminine herm orc, pretty 7</li>
                    <li>3rd level fighter, full plate, heavy steel shield, mwk dwarven waraxe, mwk heavy crossbow, 350gp on hand</li>
                    <li>Her name is both a reference to sex and a reference to breaking the thigh bone</li>
                    <li>When Sariel last met her, she was a corporal (one rank less) and a part of Ghost Bats Company</li>
                    <li>She is on her 3rd term</li>
                    <li>She knows the a prior location for the Methnaes camp: 006.021</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
		</ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        The party looks for the location of the Methnaes camp:
        <ul class="list">
            <li>The party can just stumble upon it</li>
            <li>The party can get the location of the prior camp from Sergeant Gorga Thigh Crusher</li>
            <li>The party can go to the 8 great towers and ask one of the wizards for divination</li>
            <li>The party can look for infobrokers that know where it is (DC 18 find information or ask Phidove to organize a meet with one)</li>
            <li>The party can hunt for and interrogate Methnaes soldiers</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        The party goes to the Methnaes camp (007.023):
        <ul class="list">
            <li>
                The camp looks to be large enough to handle 75 soldiers.
            </li>
            <li>
                The commanding officer of the Methnaes scouting company is Captain Alar Bani:
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Male drow, pretty 6</li>
                    <li>Directly serves Countess Eclavna Ichiir</li>
                    <li>7th level fighter, +1 full plate, heavy steel shield, +1 longsword, mwk hand crossbow, 2,900 gp</li>
                    <li>
                        He argues that Count Zesharr Black is incompetent and sitting on a chaotic, ticking time bomb, using the current rise in animal aggression 
                        and monsters as proof. He claims that Countess Eclavna Ichiir is attempting to bring law and order to Taaira Ruzara before the people are 
                        forced to suffer more than they currently are, by force if necessary.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        DC 20 diplomacy or mention of Nera's slave trading allies: Alar will reveal that part of the interest in Taaira Ruzara is in its use as a
                        way to move and source slaves.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
