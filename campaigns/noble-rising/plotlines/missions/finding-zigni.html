		The party discovers Zigni's factory. The factory is a patchwork of building materials, the core (operating room) being made of clay. The southern
		and smallest expansion (living quarters) is made of stacked logs, like a log cabin. The eastern expansion and entrance is made from wattle and daub, 
		while the northern and largest expansion (kennels) is made of a half wall of round stone and the rest of wood plank. A second building, a round house 
		with a tarred, woven stick roof serves as the kitchen. A 3 foot tall wall made of felled trees surrounds the perimeter of the factory. 3 patrols of 
		2 walk around perimeter while 2 guards protect the entrance with a caged pair of scale wolves.

					<li>The mutators only make what Zigni has already determined working mutation sets</li>
					<li>If the party asks to see Zigni, Zoe will send a carrier pigeon and Zigni will arrive in 2 hours</li>
				</ul>
