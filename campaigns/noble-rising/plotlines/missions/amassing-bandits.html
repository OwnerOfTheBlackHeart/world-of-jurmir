<h1>Amassing Bandits</h1>
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>
	Bandits have been amassing around Desserr. Rumor holds that the bandits
	are being lead by a central force. Some have even reported seeing a fortress
	having been erected almost overnight.
</p>
<p>
	The bandits have had time to establish a proper log fortification. They have taken an orcish village
	by the name of Bloodscreamer's Rest, which includes several hardened mud huts, tents, a smithy, and
	two brick storehouses. Despite the original inhabitant's claim, the Ravens Company (144 soldiers) of 
	her Majesty's army intend to take the now fortified settlement for themselves.
</p>

<h2>Quest Note</h2>
<p>
	Dear Slayers,<br/>
	&emsp;&emsp;I represent the Teamsters' and Porters' Economic Alliance of Taaira Ruzara, and I have
	placed this opportunity for mutual benefit due to a detestable risk factor to the transporters
	of the economic lifeblood of our fair county. This risk factor would be a notable rise in the
	detestable occupation of banditry, particularly of the organized kind.
</p>
<p>
	&emsp;&emsp;These foul bandits have been striking our poor movers of goods on nearly every road we have attempted
	to send them on and I have even heard word of these foul peoples striking at storehouses. I have also
	heard rumor that these organized thieves have captured a settlement for their use against the good
	peoples of Desserr. This settlement poses a serious risk to Desserr's financial state, but the guards
	refuse to act on so little information against such a large group and so I must offer some of the
	Alliance's funding for compensation for those brave souls who would find and eliminate this organized
	group of bandits.
</p>

	Lyla Hunter
