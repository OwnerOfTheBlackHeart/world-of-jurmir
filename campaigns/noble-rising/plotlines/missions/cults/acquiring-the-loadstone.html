        <ap-link-button linkName="noble-chillbreak" hash="xiiserra">Xiiserra</ap-link-button> tells the party:

                The artifact she's after is called a lodestone, and is the only one she's heard of that can be transported.
            </li>
            <li>Lodestones can occasionally be found in the wild, though their properties are mostly unknown because they "run" away.</li>
            <li>
                She will claim that she was hired to retrieve the lodestone for

            <li>
                If asked, she will present a slightly rusted and beat up iron slayer's tag.
            </li>
            <li>
                The particular ruins she's after are only about 3 miles from <ap-link-button linkName="noble-chillbreak">Chillbreak</ap-link-button>,
                but are quite well hidden.

                <b>Room 1</b>: This large room has tiled stone floors and smooth stone walls. The perfect spacing and relative smoothness, considering the ruin's
                apparent age, indicate that magic was used to either clean up the construction or to make the room. The floor is covered in splotches of mud, blood
                and some strange goop.<br/>

                <b>Room 12</b>: In the center of this room lies an obsidian altar with a sign, written in celestial, that says "Don't Touch". If a character touches the
                altar, a random evil god's avatar is summoned, though if the character thinks of a specific evil god, the avatar of that god is summoned. Instructions
                on the use of the altar are written on it in infernal (on the side facing room 10).<br/>
                If Elizabeth touches it, have it summon <ap-link-button linkName="noble-servants-of-perfect-beauty">Ilvith</ap-link-button>.

                altar, the altar may summon an efreeti, elder fire element, or noble salamander. The summoned will demand something to burn, but will otherwise be
                initially friendly. If the character thinks of a specific creature or individual from the plane of fire, the altar will instead summon what the
                character thought of. Instructions on the use of the altar are written on in it in ignan (on the side facing room room 11).
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Room 14</b>: The only object in this room is a finely made golden throne, even if the style is a few centuries out of date. If character sits in the
                chair, their alignment shifts 1 stage closer to CE, first on the good evil scale, then the lawful chaotic scale. If the character is already CE, then
                the throne grants the character a single dark wish (the wish must be distinctly evil, such as murder or a wish for dark magic). The chair applies its
                effects upon sitting down and only grants 1 wish to any specific individual.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Room 15</b>: This room contains a simple wooden table with an unremarkable wooden chest on it. No metal is present on the chest or table, with
                fire-hardened being used where metal normally would be. Compared to other rooms, this one remains unmolested, with only the layer of dust on the floor
                giving away the room's age. Within the chest is the lodestone, as well as the

                <b>Room 16</b>: In this room rests a large pool covered in some kind of goopy film (aboleth mucus). Signs of skum activity are dotted across this room.
                The aboleth mage's name is Sollmulach and he is generally friendly, unless provoked. He was born in the facility, but refuses to answer the question directly.
