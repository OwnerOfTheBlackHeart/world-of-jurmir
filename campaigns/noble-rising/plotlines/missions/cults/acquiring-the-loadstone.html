                altar, the altar may summon an efreeti, elder fire element, or noble salamander. The summoned will demand something to burn, but will otherwise be
                initially friendly. If the character thinks of a specific creature or individual from the plane of fire, the altar will instead summon what the
                character thought of. Instructions on the use of the altar are written on in it in ignan (on the side facing room room 11).

            <li>
                <b>Room 14</b>: The only object in this room is a finely made golden throne, even if the style is a few centuries out of date. If character sits in the
                chair, their alignment shifts 1 stage closer to CE, first on the good evil scale, then the lawful chaotic scale. If the character is already CE, then
                the throne grants the character a single dark wish (the wish must be distinctly evil, such as murder or a wish for dark magic). The chair applies its
                effects upon sitting down and only grants 1 wish to any specific individual.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Room 15</b>: This room contains a simple wooden table with an unremarkable wooden chest on it. No metal is present on the chest or table, with
                fire-hardened being used where metal normally would be. Compared to other rooms, this one remains unmolested, with only the layer of dust on the floor
                giving away the room's age. Within the chest is the lodestone, as well as the

                The aboleth mage's name is Sollmulach and he is generally friendly, unless provoked. He was born in the facility, but refuses to answer the question directly.
