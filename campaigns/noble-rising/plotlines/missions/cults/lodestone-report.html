<h2>Notable Reports</h2>

<h3>Report A-005-R-1</h3>
<p>
    <b>Obtainment:</b> Artifact 005 was found in the possession of a gem merchant (<span redacted>XXXXX</span> <span redacted>XXXXXXX</span>) in <span redacted>XXXXXXXXX</span>, 
    where it was purchased for 12 jade pieces on <span redacted>XX</span> <span redacted>XX</span>, <span redacted>XXX</span> <span redacted>XX</span>. A-005 was then transported
    by Seer <span redacted>XXXXXXXX</span> to Facility <span redacted>XXX</span> by leather sack.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Description:</b> Artifact 005 appears as a roughly heart sized lodestone with unreadable, black glyphs etched into it. A-005 posses the same elemental attraction as a normal
    lodestone, though this attraction also metals that a lodestone does not normally attract, such as gold or silver. A-005 also possesses the ability to move itself through
    solid stone (worked and unworked), dirt and sand, and will use these motive methods to escape when someone attempts to grab it, but otherwise A-005 remains still and inert.
</p>
<p>
    If left for extended periods in materials that A-005 can move through, it will form a small crater, roughly 2 wolf <i>[no clean translation exists, but given the older
    linguistic ques suggest that this refers to the common ancestor to wolves and direwolves]</i> skulls <i>[~4 feet]</i> in radius and one half wolf skull [~1 foot], around 
    itself. Regardless of the presence of water, A-005 forms a small pool around itself. The water in this pool posses latent arcane energies which serve a yet unknown purpose.
</p>
<p>
    A-005 displays a combination of arcane and divine magics, though do to the overwhelming arcane auras, identifying the variety and purpose of the divine magic is impossible.
    Attempts to determine further information with the use of seers has proven unsuccessful.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Storage:</b> A-005 is to be stored in a leather bag, cloth sack, or wooden box, which is to be either actively carried or placed upon a piece of furniture made of wood,
    cloth, or leather. Under no circumstances is A-005 to be placed in direct contact with stone, metal, sand, dirt or bone which connects to outside Facility 
    <span redacted>XXX</span>. If A-005 is to be placed in one of the listed materials for experimentation purposes, the material is to be contained within a wooden box which
    is elevated off the ground by either wooden struts or spider silk ropes (or ropes of similar strength).
</p>
<p>
    During long term storage, A-005 is to have <b>ABSOLUTELY</b> no contact with stone, metal, sand, dirt or bone, and must be checked upon once a week. Any changes in A-005's
    are to be reported to both Facility <span redacted>XXX</span>'s guard captain, Grand Druid <span redacted>XXXXXX</span> and Elder Arcanist <span redacted>XXXXX</span>.
</p>

<h5>Addendums</h5>
<p>
    <b>A-005-R-1-1:</b> After A-005 nearly escaped during the "I call it wine" incident, glass is to be added to the list of materials that A-005 is not allowed to come in
    contact with.
</p>
<p>
    <b>A-005-R-1-2:</b> Grand Druid <span redacted>XXXXXX</span> was transferred to Section <span redacted>XX</span>. Grand Druid <span redacted>XXXXXXXXX</span> has taken
    his place as the Grand Druid responsible for Section <span redacted>X</span>'s facilities.
</p>
<p>
    <b>A-005-R-1-3:</b> A-005 is now to be protected by 2 guards wearing <b>WOODEN</b> armor at all times. To account for physical needs and shift changes, 4 guards are to
    be assigned to A-005's storage room every shift.
</p>
<p>
    <b>A-005-R-1-4:</b> A-005's guard force is now to include 2 more members for every shift: 1 evoker, rank 6 to 9, and 1 druid, rank 4 to 9.
</p>
<p>
    <b>A-005-R-1-5:</b> 1 evoker, rank 10+, trained in sending magics and familiar with Elder Arcanist <span redacted>XXXXX</span>, is to be kept available to A-005's guards
    for each shift.
</p>

<h3>Report A-005-R-2</h3>
<p>
    <b>Working Title:</b> I call it wine<br/>
    <b>Type:</b> Incident<br/>
    <b>Cause:</b> Placement of a glass bottle upon A-005
</p>
<p>
    On <span redacted>XX</span> <span redacted>XX</span>, <span redacted>XXX</span> <span redacted>XX</span>, Guardian <span redacted>XXXXX</span> entered A-005's chamber
    heavily intoxicated, approximately <span redacted>X</span> <span redacted>XXXX</span>s before her scheduled shift while carrying an expensive glass bottle half full of
    a deep, red fluid (here after referred to as wine).
</p>
<p>
    Guardian <span redacted>XXXXX</span> approached Novice Guardian <span redacted>XXX</span> and asked if he would like to try a new drink 
    Guardian <span redacted>XXXXX</span>'s cousin made, which Guardian <span redacted>XXXXX</span> had dubbed "wine." At first Novice Guardian <span redacted>XXX</span>
    attempted to dissuade Guardian <span redacted>XXXXX</span>, claiming that he would try the "wine" after his shift ended. Guardian <span redacted>XXXXX</span>
    continued to insist, until Guardian <span redacted>XXX</span>-<span redacted>XXXX</span> decided to try the "wine."
</p>
<p>
    Upon Guardian <span redacted>XXX</span>-<span redacted>XXXX</span>'s statement that it [the particular version of the pronoun indicates a hermaphroditic creature, rather
    than a sexless one] would like to try the "wine," Guardian <span redacted>XXXXX</span> placed the glass bottle upon A-005, after which a loud "clinking" sound was heard.
    Once Guardian <span redacted>XXXXX</span> placed pewter mugs upon the table, she reached for the glass bottle, which caused A-005 to fling the bottle, which A-005 had
    moved into, at the chamber's far wall.
</p>
<p>
    The bottle shattered against the wall, allowing A-005 to rest upon the stone floor. Novice Guardian <span redacted>XXX</span> attempted to retrieve A-005, which then fled
    into the stone floor. All appropriate authorities were alerted of A-005's escape.
</p>
<p>
    Elder Arcanist <span redacted>XXXXX</span> called upon 7 seers, who were unable to find A-005 until Seer <span redacted>XXXXXXX</span> suggested that instead of trying
    to magically track A-005, trying to track where A-005 wasn't. After this, a chunk of stone where A-005 was located was identified and carefully extracted from 
    Facility <span redacted>XXX</span> and placed upon 12 fallen logs. After this, the chunk of stone was carved down until a piece of stone one wolf skull [~2 feet] by
    one wolf skull [~2 feet] by one wolf skull [~2 feet] remained. The remaining chunk was then magically flattened until A-005 was visible. The flattened chunk of stone
    was then chiseled away until only A-005 remained, which was placed into a leather bag and taken back to it's storage chamber.
</p>

<h3>Report A-005-R-7</h3>
<p>
    <b>Type:</b> Experiment<br/>
    <b>Lead Experimenter:</b> Arcanist <span redacted>XXXXXXX</span>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Plan:</b> Fill a raised wooden box with dirt and place A-005 within it, wait for A-005 to form a crater and fill the crater with water, then take 3 samples of the
    water and verify if they maintain the properties of the pool itself.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Execution:</b> A wooden chest was placed upon 6 wooden stilts and filled with dirt. After creaking was heard from the wooden stilts, spider silk ropes attached to
    the ceiling were used to carry some of the weight of the chest. Due to Arcanist <span redacted>XXXXXXX</span> complaining that his slippers were not enough to keep
    the cold from the stone floor off his feet, a woven rug was placed around the chest's stilts.
</p>
<p>
    A-005 was retrieved from it's storage chamber by Servant <span redacted>XXXXX</span> and A-005 was placed into the dirt filled chest. Arcanist <span redacted>XXXXXXX</span>
    and Servant <span redacted>XXXXX</span> left the room.
</p>
<p>
    Guardian <span redacted>XXXXX</span> and Guardian <span redacted>XXXXXXXXX</span> started a conversation while they waited for the A-005 to form its crater. During the
    conversation, Guardian <span redacted>XXXXX</span> leaned on the chest, touching their bronze armor to A-005. When Guardian <span redacted>XXXXXXXXX</span> when to
    move A-005 away from Guardian <span redacted>XXXXX</span>, A-005 traveled along Guardian <span redacted>XXXXX</span>'s armor. Guardian <span redacted>XXXXX</span>
    and Guardian <span redacted>XXXXXXXXX</span> "chased" A-005 into Guardian <span redacted>XXXXX</span>'s boot. Guardian <span redacted>XXXXXXXXX</span> presented the
    idea of removing the boot and placing it in the dirt filled chest, as the rug seemed to prevent A-005 from entering the stone floor and removing the boot shouldn't
    prompt A-005 to "run away".
</p>
<p>
    Guardian <span redacted>XXXXX</span> removed the boot, which did not cause A-005 to flee, and placed the boot within the dirt filled chest. Guardian 
    <span redacted>XXXXX</span> and Guardian <span redacted>XXXXXXXXX</span> chased A-005 out of Guardian <span redacted>XXXXX</span>'s boot after A-005
    didn't leave unprompted. 
</p>
<p>
    <b>Results:</b> A-005 demonstrated an ability to move through material too small to completely encase itself as well as an inability to move through rugs.
    All future tests of A-005 are to be carried out with a protective rug placed beneath the testing area. The water produced when A-005 creates a crater does not maintain
    its arcane energy when removed from the crater.
