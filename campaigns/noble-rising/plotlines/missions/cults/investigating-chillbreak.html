<h1>Investigating Chillbreak</h1>
<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>
	After visiting <ap-link-button linkName="noble-antys" hash="simtas">Brother Simtas</ap-link-button> in 
    <ap-link-button linkName="noble-antys">Antys</ap-link-button>, Sin was given the order to travel to the 
    town of <ap-link-button linkName="noble-chillbreak">Chillbreak</ap-link-button> and perform a routine
    inquisitorial sweep, then bring back solid evidence of any cultish activities, or lack thereof.
</p>
<p>
    The current objective of the cult of <ap-link-button linkName="cezvoc">Cezvoc</ap-link-button> is to
    use the summoning of an improved behir to draw in the nearby armies and use the chaos of the ensuing battle
    to power a ritual to worsen the monster plague.
