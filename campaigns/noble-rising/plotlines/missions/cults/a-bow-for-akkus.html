    <li>Nera visits her temple</li>
    <li>
		<ap-link-button linkName="noble-nevaeh-byrne">Nevaeh</ap-link-button> attempts to convince Nera:
		<ul class="list">
			<li>
				<ap-link-button linkName="noble-nevaeh-byrne">Nevaeh</ap-link-button> mentions that this will be a sure fire way to draw
                <ap-link-button linkName="noble-akkus">Akkus</ap-link-button> to the temple (possibly mentioning that it will be an offering
                she can't ignore).

            <li>
                If Nera pushes for it, <ap-link-button linkName="noble-nevaeh-byrne">Nevaeh</ap-link-button> will join her on the quest.

            <li>
                If Nera seems uninterested, <ap-link-button linkName="noble-nevaeh-byrne">Nevaeh</ap-link-button> will offer information
                on the cult of <ap-link-button linkName="noble-cezvoc">Cezvoc</ap-link-button>, specifically about the existence of the
                <ap-link-button linkName="noble-unworded-one">Unworded One</ap-link-button> and the fact that a single 
                <ap-link-button linkName="noble-joll-the-macabre">cleric</ap-link-button> seems to be the source of the current spreading of the cult.

		Once <ap-link-button linkName="noble-nevaeh-byrne">Nevaeh</ap-link-button> has convinced Nera, she will reveal the following potential
        bows to her:
        <ul class="list">

                to time). +2 shocking burst composite longbow (16). Targets of a crit must make a DC 20 fort save, or be stunned until the end
                of their next turn.

                <b>Yahribel</b>: A longbow seemingly made from undamaged pearl, Yahribel is said to have been wielded by a solar before they met
                their end to a powerful yuan-ti "hero". Yahribel is said to have been returned to the surface by a mind flayer trading it for

	<li>
		<ul class="list">
			<li>
				<b>Room 1:</b> This room contains the entrance to the tower, the base of the textured black tower and a stairwell 
				ascending the tower. Scuffs on the floor signal that carpeting and furniture was once housed here, but the room is 
				completely empty. The perfectly patterned granite shows further evidence of looting, as chunks have been chiseled out
				of the walls.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 5:</b> Coming up the stairs from the well looted rooms below, a layer of soot covers the final steps and the
				floor above. A smell not unlike a smokey tavern hangs heavily in the air, while a flickering light far brighter than
				a candle leaves little hope of an easy climb.
				<ul class="list">
					<li>Fire elemental, elder</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 6:</b> As one climbs to this room, the sound of a mill with no wheat can be heard. 2 huge masses of stone operate
				the milling wheel, though they become hostile upon sight of an intruder.

					<li>2 Earth Elementals, Greater</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 11:</b> The sound of heated arguments can be heard from the room above, though it is indistinct and slightly
				mad. Once a third party enters the room, the two outsiders silence themselves and immediately attack.
				<ul class="list">
					<li>Avoral</li>
					<li>Chain Devil</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 14:</b> This room, upon entry, is completely silent. Not even one's own movements make a sound.

				dries those that have finished washing.
				<ul class="list">
					<li>3 large water elementals</li>
					<li>1 large air elemental</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 22:</b> This room is furnished as a small den, with a nice, well upholstered chair and a similarly nice couch, a bookshelf
				full of entertainment books, from stories of knights and dragons to smutty stories, with a focus on lesbian stories.				
				<ul class="list">
					<li>2 Lillends</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 23:</b> A strange wind fills the stairway leading up to this room, from which a sound reminiscent of an earthquake arguing
				with a tornado emanates.
				<ul class="list">
					<li>Belker</li>
					<li>Xorn, Elder</li>

				<b>Room 24:</b> An aggressive, agitated barking comes from this room. Within the room is 5 cages, all of which have been

				<ul class="list">
					<li>Nessian Warhound</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 26:</b> Entering this room is a strange experience, as one finds themselves completely submerged but perfectly capable
				of breathing. The denizens of this room can be bought off with food 
				<ul class="list">
					<li>Elder Tojanida</li>
					<li>2 Adult Tojanida</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 27:</b> While the rooms of this tower have varied wildly in size, this room is tall in the extreme, the ceiling raising
				more than 200 feet above the top of the stairs leading to the next room. Near the top is a flat perch, upon which two beautiful,
				winged women rest. If Elizabeth is willing to part with two 5th level spell slots, she can grant them to the two women, who will
				then plane shift out of the tower.
				<ul class="list">
					<li>2 Erinyes Devils</li>
					<li>

					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 28:</b> Even from below, the agitated arguing coming from this room can be heard. Three distinct voices can be heard,
				their heated conversation switching seamlessly between goblin, worg and infernal.
				<ul class="list">
					<li>3 Greater Barghest</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 33:</b> A noble and powerful looking elven woman stands in this room, her eyes seemingly made purely of
				glowing radiant energy and her greatsword looking as if it's made of blue flames. The elf introduces herself as
				Lailah, a ghaele, an eladrin trapped here by the wizard 
				<ap-link-button linkName="noble-eight-great-towers" hash="erik-khan">Erik Khan</ap-link-button>. She implores that
				she be released from the spell that binds her here, but warns that if one gets too close to the stairs to the next
				floor, she will be forced to kill them without mercy.
				<br/><br/>
				Remove curse or dispel magic (DC 15).
				<ul class="list">
					<li>Ghaele</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 34:</b> Compared to other rooms, this room is glorious in it's splendor. The beautiful livery covering the walls
				and dragon's hoard of fine pillows all lead to a section of room that can be best described as a shrine.
				<ul class="list">
					<li>Couatl</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 36:</b> This room is oppressively hot and filled with bronze pipes and tanks. Under 2 of the tanks are flames that
				move as if they are alive, towards any intruder.
				<ul class="list">
					<li>2 huge fire elementals</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 37:</b> Connected to the floor below, a massive bronze tank holds what appears to be living water, with a small
				portion being regularly pulled away. A door with an alchemically reinforced glass window clearly displays the displeasure
				of the living water.
				<ul class="list">
					<li>Elder water elemental</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 39:</b> This room is dark, making it difficult for anyone to see, save for a single bright glowing light that
				can be seen from the stairs leading into the room.
				<ul class="list">
					<li>Devil, hellcat</li>
					<li>Bone devil</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 41:</b> This room appears to be a torture chamber, with many insidious devices along the walls. At the front center
				of the room is a young, elven woman who is chained to the wall.
				<ul class="list">
					<li>Night Hag</li>
					<li>
						Wide-Mouth Pit Trap: CR 9; mechanical; location trigger;

					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 42:</b> This room appears to be in immaculate condition, with a circle of runes drawn on the floor between 
				the stairs from below and the stairs to the next floor. The angel, Pamyel, appears from the circle and pleads for
				the party to leave the tower, as he wishes to stop being forced into pointless violence. The moment the party enters
				the floor, Pamyel will attack without hesitation.
				<ul class="list">
					<li>Angel, Astral Deva, possibly up to 3 health bars</li>
					<li>Consider adding a minor summon he can call upon</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Room 43:</b> The last fully intact room in the tower, this room is filled with collected treasures organized in
				well kept display cases, though the nicest display case, a piece of marble lined with silver and gold, holds Yahribel,
				a beautiful bow made of undamaged pearl.
