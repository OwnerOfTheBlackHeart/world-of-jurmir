<h1>Hunting Ulath</h1>
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>
	The minor god Ulath, an ascended troglodyte, is beginning to spread cults throughout
	Taaira-Ruzara. He must be killed to stop the spread of these troublesome cults before
	they cause too much damage.
</p>

<h2>Important Events to this Plotline</h2>
<h3>Attack on Cherryvale</h3>
<p>
	This small settlement in a valley to the northeast of Desserr was destroyed by the time the local
	knight had gone to collect his taxes. Almost all of the cherry trees were chopped down, the buildings
	were burnt and no bodies were found.
</p>

<h3>Attack on Elderfield</h3>
<p>
	One of the oldest farming communities to the east of Desserr hasn't sent their yearly tax and
	the knight sent to check on why the tax wasn't paid hasn't returned. A heavier scouting force
	is required to establish what the situation is.
</p>
<p>
	Ulath has burned Elderfield to the ground after killing and eating most of its inhabitants. Some
	corpses are found with the burnt remains of clothes and flesh, while others appear to have nothing
	but burnt bone and ash.
