<h2 id="book-descriptions">Book Descriptions</h2>
<h3 id="soul-hungry">Soulhungry Cock-Beasts of Hell</h3>
<p>
    Little known even amongst fans of Darklove’s works, this novel is the most outspokenly depraved of any book she has written. 
    Features outright worship of demons and devils, orgies of sex and violence, and the 'cum devil', a creature which appears throughout 
    Darklove’s works and makes contracts with others in exchange for their semen.
</p>
<p>
    No small amount of booksellers outright refuse to stock Soulhungry Cock-Beasts of Hell, and being refused for print by all but the smallest
    publishers, it is considered a collectable in the rare book collecting community (by those who even know of it).
</p>

<h3 id="andre">Andre the Dick Thief</h3>
<p>
    The story of a pansexual fuck-sorcerer who steals the cocks of his lovers (should they have one) after ending his relationships with them. 
    Generally comedic, is a saga of the various misadventures of Ande alongside graphic sex scenes, one of which involves Andre attaching all 
    of the cocks he has collected to himself and making them orgasm to flood a king’s court with semen so he could escape execution.
</p>
<p>
    While rarely the first book read by new fans of Darklove, Andre the Dick Thief is often the second, as he is a recurring character in her
    stories. It is considered one of her staples.
</p>

<h3 id="stud-1">Stud of the College - Part I</h3>
<p>
    Part one of a two part series, a stereotypical story about a male bard named Theodore who is being tutored as part of the College of Glamour. 
    As we learn, Theodore has two cocks and often throughout the book fucks multiple people at once.
</p>
<p>
    Darklove's fans will usually recommend Stud of the College as the first book a new reader should read, due to its <i>relative</i> tameness,
    general isolation from consistent characters, and two part nature (which helps hook people in).
</p>

<h3 id="stud-2">Stud of the College - Part II</h3>
<p>
    Part two of the Stud series, features Theodore travelling various kingdoms and eventually becoming the ‘cock-emperior of the Great Whorian Empire’ 
    after fucking the previous emperior so hard he became his man-wife and impregnating the emperor’s wife at the same time.
</p>
<p>
    Stud of the College - Part II is rarely sold on its own, instead being sold as a two pack with Stud of the College - Part I. Among the collectors
    of Darklove's works, the solo copy version (referred to as "first run") is a highly coveted item.
</p>

<h3 id="hermaphrozons">Hermaphrozons of the Burning Planet</h3>
<p>
    A short story about a world where women rule through fear, one sorcerer has no choice but to fuck her way to the top. In the chaos, the surface 
    of the world is scorched and everybody has to live underground.
</p>
<p>
    Due to the short nature of the story, Hermaphrozons of the Burning Planet is normally sold as a bonus story to Bloodbonded Lovers under the Moon.
</p>

<h3 id="bloodbonded">Bloodbonded Lovers under the Moon</h3>
<p>
    A story about werewolf warrior women, featuring a pair who have a (nonbiological) sisterly relationship and become lovers early on in the book. 
    Features characters from previous novels who are in some way all related to the main pair, including the Andre the Dick Theif, who stole the 
    dick of one of the women, making them a female instead of a herm. This novel is Elizabeth’s favorite.
</p>
<p>
    Considered the epitome of Darklove's writings, Bloodbonded Lovers under the Moon is a staple of the debauched erotic books community and generally considered the
    book that made Darklove's name and got her books produced in meaningful numbers.
</p>

<h3 id="outside-and-in">Outside and In: A Seminal Adventure</h3>
<p>
    The story of a Naga ‘fuck-lord’ with addictive semen. This story features a large amount of hypnosis and enslavement, as well as having the 
    most tentacles out of any book yet.
</p>
<p>
    Outside and In: A Seminal Adventure is the most controversial of Darklove’s works due to an early claim that the book hypnotized 3 elven men and
    a dwarf woman to join their nearest sex cult. Even though it was found that it was actually the sex cult's leader who magically embedded 
    <ap-link-button linkName="https://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/suggestion.htm" inline>suggestions</ap-link-button> into the accused copy, the controversy
    has made Outside and In: A Seminal Adventure popular among the debauched erotic books community.
</p>

<h3 id="the-maw-of-passion">The Maw of Passion</h3>
<p>
    This story is one focusing on some rather extreme fetishes, namely Voreaphilia and Un-Necrophilia, but with a somewhat
    lighthearted tone. it follows Hallow, a small lizard-like being with an magical maw capable of swallowing anyone and storing 
    them within her mouth, as well as using her massive, dextrous tongue as a 'tongueticle'. Halfway through the story, Hallow 
    encounters a necromancer named Necroza, who uses magically summoned black tentacles and her controlled undead to do her 'bidding'.
    Despite the extreme nature of the fetishes on display, theres enough traditional Darklove content for fans of Darklove's other works to find
    enjoyment here, even if the main focus of the content isn't their deal.
</p>
<p>
    Due to the fact that the Maw of Passion is Darklove's first self-published book, the Maw of Passion is a rare find and is only available
    in the scattered few private collections that are aware of this piece to begin with.
