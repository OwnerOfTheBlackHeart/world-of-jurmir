<h1>Inquisitors</h1>
<p>
    Inquisitors are individuals tasked with finding that which is hidden and dealing with the situation quickly and efficiently. There job is
    different from investigators in that inquisitors have the responsibility and authority to act immediately when they discover a problem.
</p>
<p>
    Inquisitors themselves come in a wide variety, differentiated by where their authority comes from and what they are expected to hunt. For example,
    a noble may elect a local inquisitor, whose authority extends only as far as the noble's authority, who is tasked with hunting down tax evaders,
    slippery criminals, and threats to the noble. Meanwhile, an inquisitor might be elected by one of the churches, tasked with hunting down heresy
    among their own ranks and ensuring the stability of the church, but be unable to act outside the church itself.
</p>
<p>
    Regardless of their duties, or the source of their authority, inquisitors are all hunters among men, judges, warriors and assassins who have
    to be ready for any situation that their job throws at them. If an inquisitor is in charge of a large area, or otherwise travels often, they
    usually assemble a party of ex-slayers or retainers to increase their operational flexibility and the scale of threats that they can challenge.
</p>

<h1 id="inquisitor-ranks">Inquisitor Ranks</h1>
<p>
    The ranks presented here are the generally accepted and common titles/ranks given to inquisitors, along with their relative levels of authority,
    responsibility, and autonomy. Not every organization will have all of these ranks and some groups/authorities prefer to give fancier titles to
    those with the responsibilities and authority of an inquisitor.
</p>

<h2 id="noble-inquisitors">Noble Elected Inquisitors</h2>
<h3 id="inquisitor-in-training">Inquisitor in Training</h3>
<p>
    Inquisitors in training are rarely feasible for nobles to elect, though those nobles who are in charge of enough inquisitors for inquisitors in training
    to be feasible, they serve as a way for a noble to turn a loyal subject into usable tool. Inquisitors in training have no authority and are simply there
    to learn and grow in capability. Depending on the amount of skill and training they have, an inquisitor in training may follow an inquisitor as an observer,
    performing simple tasks to aid in the inquisitor's investigations.
</p>

<h3 id="apprentice-inquisitor">Apprentice Inquisitor</h3>
<p>
    Baring only the authority and autonomy granted to them by their mentor, apprentice inquisitors are those who are not yet trusted or skilled enough to be
    allowed to be an independent servant of a noble. While notably more common than inquisitors in training, apprentice inquisitors still require enough inquisitors
    in service to a noble to be able to assign each apprentice inquisitor a mentor. Apprentice inquisitors are not usually trusted to perform investigations on their
    own, though they often perform an active role in their mentor's investigation.
</p>

<h3 id="inquisitor">Inquisitor</h3>
<p>
    The most common title given to inquisitors elected by nobles, an inquisitor carries the full authority of the noble who elected them and has the autonomy to
    open and conduct their own investigations, as well as determine appropriate punishments for those found to be perpetrators. Inquisitors are typically given an
    area of focus, either a particular area to watch over or a particular type of problem/threat to seek out, and are expected to remain constantly alert and deal
    with problems within their area of focus quickly and efficiently.
</p>
<p>
    Nobles may elect individuals as inquisitors if they trust enough in both the individual and their abilities. Compared to a retainer, an inquisitor is given
    more autonomy and responsibility, expected to deal with problems of their own volition, and are not given free housing, clothing and food. Instead,
    inquisitors are paid, and often given a "budget" to be spent when sent on a mission, though when necessary an inquisitor may levy resources they require.
    Inquisitors who frequently levy are unpopular with the peasantry and may have to rely on draconian means in order to force cooperation.
</p>

<h3 id="inquisitor-general">Inquisitor General</h3>
<p>
    Usually a temporary rank, inquisitor generals are elected by nobles when they feel that a particular issue or threat requires the focused efforts of multiple,
    organized inquisitors. An inquisitor general is in charge of managing those inquisitors put under their command, taking in their reports and distributing 
    discoveries, prioritizing investigations, and assigning resources, such as magic items, retainers and other servants assigned to the issue or threat.
</p>

<h3 id="high-inquisitor">High Inquisitor</h3>
<p>
    Only elected by nobles who have enough territory and inquisitors to warrant them, high inquisitors have the same authority and responsibilities as an inquisitor
    general, though they are placed in charge of a physical area of operations rather than an issue or threat, and serve until they retire or die. High inquisitors 
    also possess the ability to elect inquisitors or inquisitor generals within their given territory, though not every noble is comfortable with giving someone that 
    much power and may place restrictions on such actions.
</p>

<h2 id="divine-inquisitors">Divinely Elected Inquisitors</h2>
<h3 id="questioner">Questioner</h3>
<p>
    A questioner is an acolyte who has chosen to take the Path of the Inquisitor, but does not yet have the training or knowledge to act as an inquisitor.
    Questioners do not perform any field work, do not have any form of authority, and have no responsibilities except learning and practicing. Most questioners
    stay at inquisitorial "colleges" where experienced inquisitors instruct them on how to be inquisitors, though some questioners serve active inquisitors
    as students, though they are not yet ready to be trusted with being brought into the field.
</p>

<h3 id="examiner">Examiner</h3>
<p>
    An examiner is an acolyte who has finished their book training and is ready to directly observe an active inquisitor. Examiners lack any authority, but
    they are expected to only observe and perform basic tasks, such as running messages, given to them by their inquisitor. As an examiner gains experience,
    they may be trusted with more complex tasks, though they are not given any autonomy.
</p>

<h3 id="interrogator">Interrogator</h3>
<p>
    An interrogator is an acolyte who has learned enough to begin being given complex tasks, limited authority, and slight autonomy. Interrogators are assigned
    to some form of overseer, either an inquisitor or a member of their church who is in charge of inquisitors, who gives them assignments, grants them authority,
    and consistently reviews their performance. Unlike examiners, interrogators are expected to operate independently, but unlike inquisitors, interrogators
    are only given temporary authority, usually over the area they are being sent to investigate for only as long as their investigation takes.
</p>
<p>
    When individuals already skilled in inquisiting, often slayers or ex-guards, wish to take the Path of the Inquisitor, they are often given the rank of
    interrogator in order to further improve their skills and evaluate if they can be trusted with full inquisitorial authority.
</p>

<h3 id="inquisitor">Inquisitor</h3>
<p>
    The furthest most on the Path of the Inquisitor will go, inquisitors are the first rank to be given full authority and autonomy. While inquisitors are often
    given missions or tasks by their church or sect, inquisitors are expected to be constantly vigilant, ready to open investigations at a moment's notice or
    upon the discovery of anything suspicious. However, inquisitors are servants of the church, and if their actions anger their church or sect, they can quickly
    be stripped of their title.
</p>

<h3 id="inquisitorious-diviner">Inquisitorious Diviner</h3>
<p>
    The rank of inquisitorious diviner is given only to those inquisitors who have proven their abilities and trustworthiness to their church or sect. Inquisitorious
    diviners have all the same authority, autonomy and responsibility as a normal inquisitor, though they also command a level of respect far greater than a normal
    inquisitor. On top of that, inquisitorious diviners also have the authority to declare an investigation a matter of divine importance, which allows multiple
    inquisitors to work on the same investigation at the same time, though it does not force them to do so.
</p>

<h3 id="chosen-inquisitor">Chosen Inquisitor</h3>
<p>
    Chosen only by divine messenger, a chosen inquisitor is in charge of managing all inquisitors in an area defined by the divine messenger. Due to the fact that they
    are chosen by gods, or their representatives, few inquisitors even dare to question a chosen inquisitor.
</p>
<p>
    While most chosen inquisitors are chosen to protect an area until their death, some are instead chosen to deal with some form of event. Those chosen inquisitors
    who are chosen in order to protect against some great event only maintain their title and authority until what they have been chosen to deal with dealt with,
    after which they usually become an inquisitorious diviner.
