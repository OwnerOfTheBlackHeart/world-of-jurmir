<h1>Kikka's Note to Kali</h1>

<p>
    Dear Kali,
</p>
<p>
    During your time away from Desserr, I have learned some interesting information concerting someone who has allied themselves
    with your allies. This person is Sin Typhoon of the Spelllake Clan and has a proven track record for being a... chaotic problem.
    First, she started her fated journey by destroying 453 eggs of the Spelllake clan and earned the title of Hatchling Murderer.
</p>
<p>
    Worse than that, she claims them to have been monstrous hatchlings, but she left nothing behind to validate her claims or give
    clues as to the potential cause. Then she had sought out the drow, working on an unproven assumption that they would know of
    anything other than Sithrak and the Red King. 
</p>
<p>
    After returning from the Underdark, she participated in a mission that risked
    disturbing Dysvegr and Lindo, which could have lead to a crisis in which souls could no longer pass on. Then, once that mission
    was done, she accused a respected member of Keldhall of being a cultist after harassing said respected member of the community,
    all without any evidence. Then, when the guard followed her trail, she denied any action, resisted arrest, with magic, and was
    finally freed monetarily. After this she hunted down a cult of Ulath (some local dark god) and brought their unholy texts to the
    guard as proof of their existence. When the captain of the Keldhall guard began properly disposing of the unholy texts, Sin created
    a ruckus, then illegally used magic, which damaged the guard house and got her permanently exiled from Keldhall. 
</p>
<p>
    After finally
    arriving at Desserr, she dragged several members of Baroness Nera's retainership, against the Baroness's prior command, on a Slayer
    mission to clear out some salamanders (the ones from the Plane of Fire, not the small river lizard), the careless failure of which
    caused almost 20 square miles of valuable farmland to burn and be turned to ashen fields. I have, on good authority, that Sin had,
    through some overly aggressive mistake, directly caused the retaliatory burning.
</p>
<p>
    Sincerely,<br/>
    Kikka the Informed
</p>
