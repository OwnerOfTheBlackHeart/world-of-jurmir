		A brothel has has 7 bonuses: Comfort, Quality, Quantity, Fetish, Services, Operation
		Costs, and Customer Base. Comfort is the level of comfort for the customers, quality
		is the average quality of the "product", quantity is the amount of "product" available 
		to the customers, fetish is the amount of niche fetishes appealed to, services is the
		number of non-whoring services available, operation costs is the measures that reduce
		the cost of operating the business, and customer base is the volume or quality of
		customers available to the business.
	</p>
	<p>
		To determine the profit for a given month, roll a d100 on the 
		<ap-link-button linkName="noble-whore-house-events">events</ap-link-button> table to get the 
		major event for the month and, after applying the modifier for the month's event, roll a d20 
		and add the seven bonuses / penalties. For each point higher than 10, multiply the net roll 
		by the profit multiplier from the table below. If you roll below 10, multiply the net roll 
		by the loss multiplier from the table below. If a 10 is rolled, then the business breaks even.
	</p>
	<p>
		Unnamed whores are useful in that they are easily purchased and are an easy way to move the quantity
		value. Unnamed whores have a purchase cost based on their attractiveness (1 to 10) as well as a cost to improve
		their attractiveness. Whores who are supernaturally attractive (11+) can only be obtained through
		modifying existing whores.
	</p>
	<p>
		Whores that are acquired through RP are known as named whores and have special abilities (such as
		bards counting as 3 whores for the sake of average quality or a cleric being a powerful healer).
