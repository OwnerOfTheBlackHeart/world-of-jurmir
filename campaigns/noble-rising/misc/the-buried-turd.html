		A brothel has has 7 bonuses: Comfort, Quality, Quantity, Fetish, Services, Operation
		Costs, and Customer Base. Comfort is the level of comfort for the customers, quality
		is the average quality of the "product", quantity is the amount of 	"product" available 
		to the customers, fetish is the amount of niche fetishes appealed to, services is the
		number of non-whoring services available, operation costs is the measures that reduce
		the cost of operating the business, and customer base is the volume or quality of
		customers available to the business.
	</p>
	<p>
		To determine the profit for a given month, roll a d20 and add the seven bonuses / penalties. 
		For each point higher than 10, multiply the net roll by the profit multiplier from the table 
		below. If you roll below 10, multiply the net roll by the loss multiplier from the table below. 
		If a 10 is rolled, then the business breaks even.
