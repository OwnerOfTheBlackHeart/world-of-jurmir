<h1>Kali Rituals</h1>
<h2>Learning Rituals</h2>
<p>
	The easiest way to learn a ritual is to find information on how to perform the ritual wishing to be learned.
	However, most rituals are not going to be found that way. This leaves two other ways of learning new rituals.
</p>
<p>
	The first is to simply research topics until an unknown ritual can be researched. Once enough points in
	research topics has been gained, the GM will offer an "idea," which can be researched. Researching the idea
	takes 2 weeks and costs the research points required by the ritual. After this time, a spellcraft check is
	rolled versus the learn DC of the ritual. If failed, ritual is not learned, but can be researched again without
	costing research points. If the spellcraft check is succeeded, then the ritual is learned.
</p>
<p>
	The second way is to declare that a ritual is to be created. Describe the effects of the ritual, possibly working
	any kinks with the GM, then the GM will determine all of the information concerning the ritual. The research points
	required for the ritual must be spent, but they can be researched normally in pursuit of the ritual. After this time, 
	a spellcraft check is rolled versus the learn DC of the ritual. If failed, ritual is not learned, but can be 
	researched again without costing research points. If the spellcraft check is succeeded, then the ritual is learned.
</p>

<h2>Gaining Research Points</h2>
<p>
	Research points can be gained in one of two ways: Declare the topic being researched or declare the research being done.
	When declaring the topic being researched, the GM will declare the resources necessary for the research and may decide
	that the topic either isn't able to be researched at the moment or that the topic may count as an existing topic. If declaring
	the research being done, the GM will determine what topic(s) the research will grant a point in and if the research will
	reveal any new topics.
</p>
<p>
	Regardless of the method chosen, research takes 1 week. At the end of the week, roll a spellcraft check of DC 15 + 2 per
	topic of the research. If a success is rolled, each topic the research covers gets one research point and any topics revealed
	by the research are revealed. If the research is failed, no research points are gained and no topics are revealed, unless
	the GM decides that a hidden topic will be discovered regardless of success. Success or fail, any materials involved in the
	research are used up.

<h2>Known Rituals</h2>

<h3>Ulath's Rite of Rebirth</h3>
<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<p>
    A living, non-lizard humanoid.
</p>
<h4>Costs</h4>
<p>
	1 cup of lizardkind blood and a gem worth at least 100gp.
</p>
<h4>Focuses</h4>
<p>
	100 pounds of filth, a ritual circle carved into the ground, and a ritual dagger made of wrought iron.
</p>
<h4>Effects</h4>
<p>
	The subject is placed within the circle while the filth is lathered over the subject before being
	brought to a knee. The subject stays kneeling, willingly or by force, for 2 hours while they are
	continually lathered with the filth. During this time, a ritual lead chants arcane words while pouring
	the cup of blood, drop by drop, into the grooves of the ritual circle. At the end of the two hours,
	the ritual lead impales the wrought iron dagger into the heart, or head, of the subject, killing them.
	Any remaining filth is placed over the subject while the dagger remains in the subject. 24 hours later,
	the subject rises as a troglodyte.
</p>
<p>
	If the subject has 2, or less, class levels, it looses all memory of its past and rises as a standard
	troglodyte. If the subject has 3, or more, class levels (npc or pc) it loses all racial levels and all
	ability score modifiers, special attacks, natural armor, special abilities, and all else related to race.
	The subject then gains all the abilities, hit dice, natural weapons, natural armor, and special abilities
	of a troglodyte. The subject does not gain any extra experience if the racial levels would leave the subject
	at a higher ECL than before the ritual. Instead, the amount of experience required to reach the next
	level increases appropriately.
