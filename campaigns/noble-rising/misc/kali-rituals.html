<h3>Ulath's Rite of Rebirth</h3>
<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<p>
    A living, non-lizard humanoid.
</p>
<h4>Costs</h4>
<p>
	1 cup of lizardkind blood and a gem worth at least 100gp.
</p>

<h4>Focuses</h4>
<p>
	100 pounds of filth, a ritual circle carved into the ground, and a ritual dagger made of wrought iron.
</p>

<h4>Effects</h4>
<p>
	The subject is placed within the circle while the filth is lathered over the subject before being
	brought to a knee. The subject stays kneeling, willingly or by force, for 2 hours while they are
	continually lathered with the filth. During this time, a ritual lead chants arcane words while pouring
	the cup of blood, drop by drop, into the grooves of the ritual circle. At the end of the two hours,
	the ritual lead impales the wrought iron dagger into the heart, or head, of the subject, killing them.
	Any remaining filth is placed over the subject while the dagger remains in the subject. 24 hours later,
	the subject rises as a troglodyte.
</p>
<p>
	If the subject has 2, or less, class levels, it looses all memory of its past and rises as a standard
	troglodyte. If the subject has 3, or more, class levels (npc or pc) it loses all racial levels and all
	ability score modifiers, special attacks, natural armor, special abilities, and all else related to race.
	The subject then gains all the abilities, hit dice, natural weapons, natural armor, and special abilities
	of a troglodyte. The subject does not gain any extra experience if the racial levels would leave the subject
	at a higher ECL than before the ritual. Instead, the amount of experience required to reach the next
	level increases appropriately.

		blood into pure dragon blood (rainbow dragon, near Kyranious) at a 10:10:1 ratio. Purifying takes 1 hour per
		cup of purified blood produced.

		When used to dilute dragon blood, pure dragon blood because metallic and chromatic dragon blood at a 1:8:8
		ratio, true dragon blood to dragon typed blood at a 1:8 ratio, and dragon typed blood to dragonblooded blood
		at a 1:8 ratio. Diluting takes 1 hour per cup of blood being diluted.
