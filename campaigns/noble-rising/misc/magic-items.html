    <p>
        This gauntlet, seeming to be made of a solid black material with a fluid interior, rests hungrily until a motive entity
        can retrieve it and bring it to its favored feasts. When one puts on the Gauntlet That Knows, it resizes and changes shape
        to fit them.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Gauntlet That Knows can be asked questions, to which it will respond with visions or memories. However, the Gauntlet That Knows
        is incapable of forming telepathic speech, only able to recycle memories of speech that it has into an attempt to directly communicate.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Gauntlet That Knows's knowledge is vast, but still finite. This predator of memories, however, is more than willing to
        guide its host to the nearest "food," a type of crystallized memory or a brain that has been specially preserved through
        arcane magical means.

    <ap-auth-container permissions="gm noble-full gauntlet-that-knows-powers">
        <p>
            <i class="power">Pop Open the Can (Su):</i> The Gauntlet That Knows allows its wearer to, once per day as 
            a main action, make a melee touch attack. If the melee touch attack misses, this power is not considered used. On a hit, 
            if the target is bloodied, the Gauntlet That Knows goes straight for the target's skull, aiming to peel open the skull
            and feast upon the brain. The target must make a DC 22 fortitude save or immediately die as if by a death effect.
        </p>
        <p>
            <i class="power">Psionic Powers (Sp):</i> The Gauntlet That Knows allows the wearer to manifest as if a psion of with a level
            equal to their hit dice, using the higher of their intelligence or wisdom as their manifesting stat, with a total number of 
            power points per day equal to twice their hit dice. 2nd level powers require a minimum effective level of 3, 3rd requires level 5,
            4th requires level 7, 5th requires level 9, 6th requires level 11, 7th requires level 13, 8th requires level 15, and 9th requires
            level 17.

            The Gauntlet That Knows was created by a devil long forgotten for a purpose that is lost on even the gauntlet itself.
