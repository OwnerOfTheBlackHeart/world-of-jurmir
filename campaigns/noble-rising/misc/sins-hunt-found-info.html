<h1>Sin's Hunt Found Info</h1>
<p>
    This page contains information that has been given to Sin Typhoon concerning her hunt as to why the
    hatchlings of the Spelllake Clan had hatched as corrupted monsters.

		Cezvoc, god of monsters, is the actual cause of the mutations. The abominations that were birthed from the eggs were abnormally large
        and aggressive with spiked spines, tails with stingers (like wyverns) and bone blades on their wrists and elbows.

    Prior to the start of the game, Sin traveled to the Underdark in order to talk to the drow about possible
    information related to the hatchlings being monsters. While the drow don't know much about the minor gods on the surface,
    or other possible causes, they are well versed in the <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button>
    and his followers. She learned:
</p>
<ul class="list">
    <li>
        The blood of aberrations can corrupt normal creatures, turning them into mutated monsters or aberrations. Dead aberrations
        should be cleansed by burning the corpse to ash.
    </li>
    <li>
        The followers of the <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button> have, in the past, developed 
        magic that allows the corruption of creatures. This magic is frequently lost due to the intervention of other forces, 
        but almost all forms of the magic either create a new creature or mutate an unborn child. They view this as unlikely 
        due to the mutation magic being expensive and precise. 
    </li>
    <li>
        The <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button> likes to whisper to those who seek the powers of destruction.
        His requests often seem simple, but usually have horrific long term effects.
    </li>
    <li>
        While demons and devils usually work for the interests of themselves and their hidden lords within hell, some will work
        as forces of the <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button>, convincing mortals that they are working
        for/with a demon king or devil lord when they are actually doing the <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King's</ap-link-button>
        bidding.
    </li>
    <li>
        While rust monsters are aberrations, naturally born rust monsters lack the corrupting properties of other aberrations. Magically
        created rust monsters do possess the corrupting properties, though they can be told apart from natural rust monsters because of their
        significantly increased aggression.
    </li>
    <li>
        Corruption typically results in some of the following mutations:
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Extra limbs, such as extra arms, legs, wings or tails.</li>
            <li>Tentacles on creatures that shouldn't normally have them.</li>
            <li>Multiple mouths, typically filled with either sharp, dagger-like teeth or saw-like teeth.</li>
            <li>More eyes than is typical for a normal creature. They may grow near normal eyes, around the head, or all over the body.</li>
            <li>
                The ability to speak multiple words at the same time. This is particularly useful for speaking Voidspeak quickly, as the language
                relies of multiple sentences being spoken at the same time.
            </li>
            <li>Murderous madness, usually paired with a strong need for cannibalism.</li>
            <li>Thick, fatty skin, usually with an oily or goopy secretion covering it.</li>
            <li>Resistance, or immunity, to damage from strong acids.</li>
            <li>Poison glands, which usually lessen the target's strength or start to render them insane.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Some of the drow that travel to the surface have reported that a Lady Nera Black is known for carrying the 
        unholy symbols of cultists she's killed. She has 2 symbols, one of an unknown god and one of the 
        <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button> as of the last reports.
