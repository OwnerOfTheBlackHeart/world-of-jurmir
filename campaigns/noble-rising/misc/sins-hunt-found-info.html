<h1>Sin's Hunt Found Info</h1>
<p>
    This page contains information that has been given to Sin Typhoon concerning her hunt as to why the
    hatchlings of the Spelllake Clan had hatched as corrupted monsters.
</p>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm sin-mutations-cause noble-full">
	<p>
		Cezvoc, god of monsters, is the actual cause of the mutations. The abominations that were birthed from the eggs were abnormally large
        and aggressive with spiked spines, tails with stingers (like wyverns) and bone blades on their wrists and elbows.

<h2 id="drow">Drow</h2>
<p>
    Prior to the start of the game, Sin traveled to the Underdark in order to talk to the drow about possible
    information related to the hatchlings being monsters. While the drow don't know much about the minor gods on the surface,
    or other possible causes, they are well versed in the <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button>
    and his followers. She learned:
</p>
<ul class="list">
    <li>
        The blood of aberrations can corrupt normal creatures, turning them into mutated monsters or aberrations. Dead aberrations
        should be cleansed by burning the corpse to ash.
    </li>
    <li>
        The followers of the <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button> have, in the past, developed 
        magic that allows the corruption of creatures. This magic is frequently lost due to the intervention of other forces, 
        but almost all forms of the magic either create a new creature or mutate an unborn child. They view this as unlikely 
        due to the mutation magic being expensive and precise. 
    </li>
    <li>
        The <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button> likes to whisper to those who seek the powers of destruction.
        His requests often seem simple, but usually have horrific long term effects.
    </li>
    <li>
        While demons and devils usually work for the interests of themselves and their hidden lords within <ap-link-button linkName="hell">Hell</ap-link-button>, some will work
        as forces of the <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button>, convincing mortals that they are working
        for/with a demon king or devil lord when they are actually doing the <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King's</ap-link-button>
        bidding.
    </li>
    <li>
        While rust monsters are aberrations, naturally born rust monsters lack the corrupting properties of other aberrations. Magically
        created rust monsters do possess the corrupting properties, though they can be told apart from natural rust monsters because of their
        significantly increased aggression.
    </li>
    <li>
        Corruption typically results in some of the following mutations:
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Extra limbs, such as extra arms, legs, wings or tails.</li>
            <li>Tentacles on creatures that shouldn't normally have them.</li>
            <li>Multiple mouths, typically filled with either sharp, dagger-like teeth or saw-like teeth.</li>
            <li>More eyes than is typical for a normal creature. They may grow near normal eyes, around the head, or all over the body.</li>
            <li>
                The ability to speak multiple words at the same time. This is particularly useful for speaking Voidspeak quickly, as the language
                relies of multiple sentences being spoken at the same time.
            </li>
            <li>Murderous madness, usually paired with a strong need for cannibalism.</li>
            <li>Thick, fatty skin, usually with an oily or goopy secretion covering it.</li>
            <li>Resistance, or immunity, to damage from strong acids.</li>
            <li>Poison glands, which usually lessen the target's strength or start to render them insane.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Some of the drow that travel to the surface have reported that a Lady Nera Black is known for carrying the 
        unholy symbols of cultists she's killed. She has 2 symbols, one of an unknown god and one of the 
        <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button> as of the last reports.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Ulath</h2>
<p>
    Sin found some religious texts and ritual guides of Ulath while killing off the Ulath cult under Keldhall.
</p>
<ul class="list">
    <li>The cultists of Ulath will transform willing and unwilling, living adults into troglodytes.</li>
    <li>Ulath is a god of filthy places, cannibalism, disease and destruction.</li>
    <li>Ulath cults prey on the homeless and outcast.</li>
    <li>
        The ritual that Ulath cultists use to transform people into troglodytes is called Ulath's Rite of Rebirth
        <ul>
            <li>
                The subject is placed within the circle while the filth is lathered over the subject before being brought to a knee. 
                The subject stays kneeling, willingly or by force, for 2 hours while they are continually lathered with the filth. 
                During this time, a ritual lead chants arcane words while pouring the cup of blood, drop by drop, into the grooves of the ritual circle. 
                At the end of the two hours, the ritual lead impales the wrought iron dagger into the heart, or head, of the subject, killing them. 
                Any remaining filth is placed over the subject while the dagger remains in the subject. 24 hours later, the subject rises as a troglodyte.
                <br/><br/>
                If the subject has 2, or less, class levels, it looses all memory of its past and rises as a standard troglodyte. If the subject has 3, or more, 
                class levels (npc or pc) it loses all racial levels and all ability score modifiers, special attacks, natural armor, special abilities, and 
                all else related to race. The subject then gains all the abilities, hit dice, natural weapons, natural armor, and special abilities of a 
                troglodyte. The subject does not gain any extra experience if the racial levels would leave the subject at a higher ECL than before the 
                ritual. Instead, the amount of experience required to reach the next level increases appropriately.
