    <h2>Letter to Nera</h2>
    <p>
        Dearest Nera,<br/>
        &emsp;I may tell you that you are only to help your great uncle Zesharr, but I
        am sending you there for a reason greater than just helping my hapless uncle.
        It is time that you gain your own lands, as your brothers before you have. I would
        advise that you take your time to grow in strength, influence, and trust before
        taking your great uncle's throne. And don't worry about rightful heirs, for he
        has never taken a bride or even a concubine.
    </p>
    <p>
        &emsp;Also, go knowing that I love you and have every expectation that you will
        live. If you feel the need to seek advice in the art of slaying, your grandfather's
        old friend Reth'Mailynath at the Slayers' Guild will be more than willing to give
        you what instruction you may need.
    </p>
    <p>
        Love,<br/>
        Dad

    Whole lot of shit happened. Going to go deal with goblins. Currently staying in a motel
    with Nera, Butler, and Sariel in one room and Paedir and Galadriel.
