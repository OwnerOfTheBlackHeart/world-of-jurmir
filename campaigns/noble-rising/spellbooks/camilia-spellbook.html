<h1>Camilia's Spellbook</h1>
<p>
    This spellbook is bound in raptor pelt and filled with heavy parchment pages. The writing is
    organized, but rough, gnollish written in primarily green and red inks, though blues and blacks
    occasionally pop up. Closer investigation will show that the inks are all made from natural sources,
    with the red and black inks being made from monster blood.
