<h1>Kali's Spellbook</h1>
<p>
	The cover of this spellbook is made of leather that has translucent scales that appear
	to have the leather consuming them. Depending on the lighting, these scales may also
	reflect the colors of chromatic and metallic dragons, usually in a manor reminiscent of
	a rainbow. The spells of the spellbook are written on parchment that appears to also
	be in the process of being consumed by the leather and framed by it as well.
</p>
<p>
	The front and back covers are slightly chared about halfway up the covers.
