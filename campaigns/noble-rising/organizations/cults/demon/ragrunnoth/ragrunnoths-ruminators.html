<p>
   Ragrunnoth's Ruminators is a cult worshipping the glabrezu Ragrunnoth, whom they worship for his promises of power and wealth. The cult lacks any
   form of structure without internal clout coming from one's ability to control others and/or their personal wealth.

    <h3>Ragrunnoth</h3>
    <p>
        Ragrunnoth is a glabrezu who is worshiped for his promises of power and wealth. He uses his cultists to create perpetual schemes that slowly drain
        communities of their wealth and bring about economic ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ragrunnoth teaches that power and wealth are finite resources that must be taken, as "earning" them takes too long to be meaningful.
