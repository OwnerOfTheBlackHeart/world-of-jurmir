<h1>The Servants of Perfect Beauty</h1>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    The Servants of Perfect Beauty is a cult worshipping the succubus <ap-link-button linkName="noble-ilvith">Ilvith</ap-link-button>, whom they worship for her 
    beauty and charisma. The cult lacks any real structure, with social and political clout coming from ones beauty, how often they've personally served 
    <ap-link-button linkName="noble-ilvith">Ilvith</ap-link-button> and how much <ap-link-button linkName="noble-ilvith">Ilvith</ap-link-button> has used them as 
    a canvas for her art.
</p>
<p>
    Among the Servants of Perfect Beauty, being more beautiful than one's head priest/priestess is considered a direct challenge, which rarely ends well.
    Instead, careful and/or smart members of the Servants have learned to share their secrets of beauty with their head priest/priestess so as to be able
    to improve their own appearance without threatening the head priest's/priestesses' position.

    thats fair. I'm thinking I might end up having it be more similar to the Greco-Roman Mysteries actually
    I.E. theres a town of supernaturally beautiful people, outsiders may or may not know they worship a 'goddess of supreme beauty' or may think they worship beauty itself, 
    however ritual practices and the deeper parts of the religion beyond that are only available to the initiated. I could imagine that the whole point of this is to, 
    in a way, Misguide outsiders of their goddess's true nature. Sure she may be Beauty personified but not everyone can withstand the radiance of her perfected visage. 
    This may even lead others to the point of believing she's of a different alignment than she truly is, because as outsiders they are only allowed a pale reflection of 
    true beauty.

    <li>One should strive to be more beautiful than the rest of the room, not the most beautiful in the room.</li>
    <li>A silver tongue and a platinum form can subdue nations, but a sword can only subdue the weak.</li>
    <li>Art is expression, which is beauty, which is happiness.</li>

    "It is rude and insulting to be more beautiful than your sect's high priest/priestess. Matching them is a compliment, but being more beautiful than them is 
    effectively saying that they shouldn't have their position so close to Ilvith. Those who are good at working around rules have found an easy exploitation of 
    this rule: To pass secrets of their own beauty to the high priest/priestess and wait for them to integrate said secrets before doing so themselves, so as to 
    surpass everyone else in beauty except the high priest/priestess."

    The Servants of Perfect Beauty are generally fairly isolationistic, preferring to hide the fact that they are a cult, but they may silently ally themselves
    with those they view as being attractive while avoiding those they view as being unappealing.

    While the Servants of Perfect Beauty consider the <ap-link-button linkName="noble-fallenfeather-sisterhood">Fallenfeather Sisterhood</ap-link-button> to
    have a collective rod up their asses, they consider them to be useful friends to have. Thus, the Servants are more than happy to offer members of the 
    <ap-link-button linkName="noble-fallenfeather-sisterhood">Fallenfeather Sisterhood</ap-link-button> shelter and assistance. It doesn't hurt that the sisters
    of the <ap-link-button linkName="noble-fallenfeather-sisterhood">Fallenfeather Sisterhood</ap-link-button> are typically beautiful.
