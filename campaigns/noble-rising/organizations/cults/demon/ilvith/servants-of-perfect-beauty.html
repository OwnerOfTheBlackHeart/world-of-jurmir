<h1>The Servants of Perfect Beauty</h1>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    The Servants of Perfect Beauty is a cult worshipping the succubus Ilvith, whom they worship for her beauty and charisma. The cult lacks any real structure,
    with social and political clout coming from ones beauty, how often they've personally served Ilvith and how much Ilvith has used them as a canvas for her
    art. The Servants live in the XXX of XXX, trying to pass themselves off as simply a settlement of beautiful people.

    The Servants of Perfect Beauty are generally fairly isolationistic, preferring to hide the fact that they are a cult, but they may silently ally themselves
    with those they view as being attractive and avoiding those they view as being unappealing.

    While the Servants of Perfect Beauty consider the <ap-link-button linkName="noble-fallenfeather-sisterhood">Fallenfeather Sisterhood</ap-link-button> to
    have a collective rod up their asses, but to be useful friends to have. Thus, the Servants are more than happy to offer members of the 
    <ap-link-button linkName="noble-fallenfeather-sisterhood">Fallenfeather Sisterhood</ap-link-button> shelter and assistance. It doesn't hurt that the sisters
    of the <ap-link-button linkName="noble-fallenfeather-sisterhood">Fallenfeather Sisterhood</ap-link-button> are typically beautiful.

        Ilvith is a succubus who is worshipped for her beauty and charisma. She uses her cultists as servants, playthings, and art pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ilvith teaches that beauty is what is to be strived for most and that her worshipers should do anything they can to become more beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ilvith wants to impregnate <ap-link-button linkName="noble-akkus">Akkus</ap-link-button> with her child(ren).
    </p>
    <p>
        When the party first meets Ilvith, she'll be looking to have them aid her in making someone fall in love with her strong enough that they will kill their
        family for her. She intends to make this person her first cleric.
