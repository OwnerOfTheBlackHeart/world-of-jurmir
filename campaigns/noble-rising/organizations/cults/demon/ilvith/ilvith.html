    <p>
        Ilvith's natural weapons, as well as any weapons she wields, are treated as evil-aligned and chaotic-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
    </p>

    <p>
        <i class="power">Energy Drain (Su):</i> Ilvith drains energy from a mortal she lures into some act of passion, or by simply planting a kiss on the victim. 
        If the target is not willing to be kissed, the Ilvith must start a grapple, which provokes an attack of opportunity. The Ilvith’s kiss or embrace bestows 
        one negative level. The kiss also has the effect of a suggestion spell, asking the victim to accept another kiss from the Ilvith. The victim must succeed on 
        a DC 27 Will save to negate the effect of the suggestion. The DC is 27 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. These save DCs are Charisma-based. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <i class="power">Glacia's Poison (Su):</i> The stinger at the end of Glacia still oozes venom, despite having long been severed from a wyvern. Due to the
        wyvern that the stinger was pulled from, the poison is as follows: Injury, Fortitude DC 20, initial and secondary damage 2d6 Con.
    </p>

    <p>
		<i class="power">Spell-like abilities:</i>
		At will—<i>charm monster</i> (DC 25), <i>detect good</i>, <i>detect thoughts</i> (DC 23), <i>ethereal jaunt</i> (self plus 50 pounds of objects only),
        <i>suggestion</i> (DC 24), <i>greater teleport</i> (self plus 50 pounds of objects only). Caster level 12th. The save DCs are Charisma-based. 
	</p>
    
    <p>
        <i class="power">Summon Demon (Sp):</i> Once per day Ilvith can attempt to summon 1 vrock with a 80% chance of success or 3 succubi with a 30% chance of success. 
        This ability is the equivalent of a 3rd-level spell. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <i class="power">Change Shape (Su):</i> Ilvith can assume the form of any Small, Medium or Large humanoid or monstrous humanoid. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <i class="power">Tongues (Su):</i> Ilvith has a permanent tongues ability (as the spell, caster level 12th). Ilvith usually uses verbal communication with mortals.

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
	Ilvith is a 6' 6" tall, female succubus with perfect, light gray skin, a seductive feminine build, thick, flowing black hair that rests about an inch above the
    ground when she stands still, silver, metal-like bull's horns that jut out to the side, then up and forward, large, silver bat-like wings with pronounced and bony
    clawed thumb, and breasts that change size to match the preference of her current target, though they rest between B and C cups when she's not trying to "play" with
    someone. <i>Due to the complexity of Ilvith's normal outfit, I will refrain from attempting to describe it in words</i>.
</p>
<p>
    Ilvith's personal weapon is a thick, black whip tipped with a sharpened wyvern's stinger that, when not in use, wraps around her right arm with the stinger on the
    outside of her upper arm and the handle along the forearm, easily able to be gripped or mentally commanded her hand. The whip's name is Glacia and is a +2 icy burst
    whip dagger.
</p>

<ap-auth-container permissions="gm ilvith-combat-and-history noble-full elizabeth">
    <h2 id="history">History</h2>
    <p>
        Ilvith is a succubus from the time shortly before the sealing of the <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button> and the creation of
        <ap-link-button linkName="zoltan">Zoltan</ap-link-button>. While she didn't end up participating in any of the raging battles, Ilvith has been on and off the 
        material plane, slowly preparing for the day that she would be able to grab enough power to stay anchored away from <ap-link-button linkName="hell">Hell</ap-link-button>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once all of her preparations were complete, Ilvith waited for her next summons to the material plane, and upon the call convinced the cultists that summoned her
        to fully summon her to the material plane, after which she drained each of their life force and burned their corpses. Free to walk the material, Ilvith tracked down
        the many magical items, ritual components, books, and scrolls she'd prepared, gathering them in a cave deep within the Mount of Decay. In the hidden cave, Ilvith
        worked to gather the magical energies necessary to make her into a god, even if a minor one.
    </p>
    <p>
        After several years summoning for the needed well of magical energy, Ilvith performed the binding ritual and bathed in the well, pulling all the energy into herself.
    </p>
    <p>
        After her bath in the magical energies, Ilvith cocooned herself in silk, precious metals, gems and illusions, sleeping for another decade. When she awoke, Ilvith was
        as she is now, a demon minor god. Understanding the fragility of being a god without worshipers, Ilvith set out to acquire her first cleric. In a ruined containment
        facility outside <ap-link-button linkName="noble-chillbreak">Chillbreak</ap-link-button>, Ilvith was summoned by Elizabeth, who would decide to become the Ilvith's
        first cleric.
    </p>

    <h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
    <p>
        Ilvith, while more than confident in her abilities to fight on her own, prefers to have a horde of minions to use against her enemies. Regardless of the presence of
        meat shields, Ilvith will prefer to use her illusion and enchantment abilities to force her enemies into chaos, forcing them to fight themselves, over using her limited
        selection of offensive spells or having to fight herself. If any enemies begin to target Ilvith, she will quickly deploy any defensive spells she has available.
    </p>
    <p>
        If Ilvith has a meat wall protecting her from her enemies, she may advance to the meat wall and use Glacia to strike at the strongest enemy blocked by the line.
    </p>
    <p>
        Due to the fact she can't hover, Ilvith doesn't typically fly during combat, preferring to cast and attack from the ground and only fly when she needs to quickly
        reposition.
    </p>
