    <h3>Kugmoxon</h3>
    <p>
        Kugmoxon is a balor who is worshiped for his strength and his power. He uses his cultists to constantly feed himself and live in luxury,
        though he is willing to give up all of it if it would keep him out of <ap-link-button linkName="hell">Hell</ap-link-button>. Kugmoxon is lazy, 
        but he's always up for a "good old fashioned killing."
    </p>
    <p>
        Kugmoxon teaches that power is the path to freedom and that anything that grants power makes right.
