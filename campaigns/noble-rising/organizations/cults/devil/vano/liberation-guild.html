<h1>The Liberation Guild</h1>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    The Liberation Guild is a cult worshipping the cornugon Vano, whom they worship for his promises of freedom from <ap-link-button linkName="Sithrak">
    Sithrak</ap-link-button>. The Liberation Guild has three distinct branches: The Priests who publicly serve Zoltan and offer liberation from one's sins,
    which is secretly a method to recruit new members, the Rangers who actively hunt down the forces of <ap-link-button linkName="Sithrak">Sithrak</ap-link-button>
    and kill them, and the Wizards who seek to find a way to kill <ap-link-button linkName="Sithrak">Sithrak</ap-link-button>.

    <li>A powerful foe must never be allowed to escape.</li>

    The Liberation Guild will work with other cults when it is convenient, but they generally prefer to work on their own. The exception to this is <ap-link-button
    linkName="noble-fallenfeather-sisterhood">the Fallenfeather Sisterhood</ap-link-button>, who Liberation Guild members will work with whenever possible.

    <h3>Vano</h3>
    <p>
        Vano is a cornugon (horned devil) who was summoned to the Material Plane 100 years ago by an unknown force, however when he was summoned, he ended up locked
        in a ruined fortress. A few years ago, Vano was able to escape and has begun a personal crusade against the forces of Sithrak. Vano uses his cultists to hunt
        down and kill Sithraki forces, such as clerics and true drow.
    </p>
    <p>
        Vano teaches his servants that destroying Sithrak will allow the forces of <ap-link-button linkName="hell">Hell</ap-link-button> to march onto the Material 
        Plane and allow them become demons themselves.
