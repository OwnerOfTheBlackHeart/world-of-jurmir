<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
	Akkus is a 7' 8" tall erinyes with chalk white skin, straight, lower back length white hair, a pair of white feathered wings, coal black eyes and lips. Akkus's
    hair and feathers have blood red tips. Akkus wears a set of elaborate, black full plate with a complementary black halberd.
</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>
    Akkus was born an astral deva (angel) and served under <ap-link-button linkName="hrefna">Hrefna</ap-link-button>. Akkus, who has given up the name she had at the
    time, fell when she was ordered to cause a thorp of poachers from over-hunting the land around them and, instead, enslaved the thorp, killing any who wouldn't
    bend knee to here. While the enslavement of the thorp was the beginning of Akkus's fall, her fall wasn't instant and continued slowly as Akkus used her slaves to
    enact her will on the material plane. On the final day of her fall, <ap-link-button linkName="hrefna">Hrefna</ap-link-button> decided she had enough of Akkus's
    continued betrayal and told <ap-link-button linkName="sithrak">Sithrak</ap-link-button>, who had his emberred kill her slaves while he bound Akkus's soul to 
    <ap-link-button linkName="hell">Hell</ap-link-button>. However, before <ap-link-button linkName="sithrak">Sithrak</ap-link-button> could drag Akkus into 
    <ap-link-button linkName="hell">Hell</ap-link-button>, she managed to escape.
</p>
<p>
    Free from the grips of <ap-link-button linkName="hell">Hell</ap-link-button>, but alone in her escape, Akkus set about founding the
    <ap-link-button linkName="noble-fallenfeather-sisterhood">Featherfallen Sisterhood</ap-link-button> to protect her from the forces of 
    <ap-link-button linkName="sithrak">Sithrak</ap-link-button> and enact her will upon the material plane. Learning from her failures during her fall, Akkus built the
    <ap-link-button linkName="noble-fallenfeather-sisterhood">Sisterhood</ap-link-button> around her worship, a strict hierarchy, and secrecy.
</p>
<p>
    Due to her focus on secrecy and fear of <ap-link-button linkName="sithrak">Sithrak</ap-link-button> dragging her into 
    <ap-link-button linkName="hell">Hell</ap-link-button>, Akkus considers cults that draw attention to themselves her enemies, as they can cause inquisitors 
    to start snooping around.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
    Akkus prefers to avoid direct combat, instead relying on her servants and magics to disrupt and destroy her enemies. When forced into direct combat, she will rely
    on her magics to break up enemy formations and then attack the weakest formations, either with her halberd or with a powerful bow.
