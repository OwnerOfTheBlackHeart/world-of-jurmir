<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    The Fallenfeather Sisterhood is a cult worshipping the true erinyes <ap-link-button linkName="noble-akkus">Akkus</ap-link-button>, devoted to protecting 
    her from the forces that would take her to <ap-link-button linkName="hell">Hell</ap-link-button> and working towards making 
    <ap-link-button linkName="noble-akkus">Akkus</ap-link-button> a god. All members of the Fallenfeather Sisterhood are female, with the rare feminine hermaphrodite 
    being called a breeder.
</p>
<p>
    The Fallenfeather Sisterhood is a highly structured military organization with room for the most capable to ascend the ranks. The Sisterhood
    is broken into four branches: The Furies, who serve as the assassins of <ap-link-button linkName="noble-akkus">Akkus</ap-link-button>, the Kides, 
    who are in charge of protecting <ap-link-button linkName="noble-akkus">Akkus</ap-link-button> and the Sisterhood, the Katas, who are the spies and 
    seekers of knowledge, and the Fones, who guide the worship of <ap-link-button linkName="noble-akkus">Akkus</ap-link-button>. Interbranch competition 
    is almost unheard of within the Sisterhood, but intrabranch competition is a constant, with the need to be acknowledged by superiors causing 
    individuals to challenge themselves and seek out new ways to please their goddess, even forming small teams to accomplish certain tasks.

    <li>Being unintentionally discovered is as deadly as any blade, and must be dealt with quickly.</li>
    <li>The interests of <ap-link-button linkName="noble-akkus">Akkus</ap-link-button> come first, your superiors second, yours third and your inferiors last.</li>

<p>
    The Fallenfeather Sisterhood is not above working with other cults, evil, good or somewhere in between, however, their general paranoia and mission means
    that the Sisterhood only works with cults of similar secrecy and avoids, or destroys, cults that draw attention to themselves.
</p>
<p>
    While the Fallenfeather Sisterhood considers the <ap-link-button linkName="noble-servants-of-perfect-beauty">Servants of Perfect Beauty</ap-link-button> 
    to be a chaotic mess, they maintain a positive relationship with them and will offer shelter and assistance to the Servants, though they expect these boons 
    to be available when the Sisterhood needs them.
</p>
<p>
    The Fallenfeather Sisterhood works closely with <ap-link-button linkName="noble-liberation-guild">Liberation Guild</ap-link-button> agents whenever they can.
</p>
<p>
    The Fallenfeather Sisterhood consider the rare opportunity to work with the <ap-link-button linkName="noble-second-order">Second Order</ap-link-button>
    a pleasure.
