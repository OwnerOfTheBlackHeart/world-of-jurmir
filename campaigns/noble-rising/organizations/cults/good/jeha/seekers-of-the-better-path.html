<h1>Seekers of the Better Path</h1>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    The Seekers of the Better Path is a cult worshiping the avoral (guardinal) Jeha, who guides the Seekers in a quest to find a better way to keep 
    <ap-link-button linkName="the-void">the Void</ap-link-button> locked shut, preferably without sacrifices. The cult is organized into 3 roles: Speaker,
    Keeper, and Seeker. The Speakers communicate with Jeha and distributes her commands among the Seekers of the Better Path. The Keepers have two roles:
    To manage and protect the Grand Atheneum, and to protect writings and artifacts as they are brought to the Grand Atheneum. The Seekers hunt down new information
    that can further the goals of the Seekers of the Better Path, as well as research and study options new and old.
</p>
<p>
    The Seekers of the Better Path view the power and influence of Sithrak to be a problem and aim to create a reality in which he is not needed.
</p>
<p>
    The Seekers have a strong fascination with pre-god magics.

    <h3>Jeha</h3>
    <p>
        Jeha is an avoral (guardinal) who seeks to find a better way to keep <ap-link-button linkName="the-void">the Void</ap-link-button> locked shut, preferably a method that
        doesn't require any form of sacrifices. She hopes that by doing this, she can lessen Sithrak's power and influence among mortals and gods, and to be able to rid the world
        of his creations. Jeha uses her cultists to seek answers on pre-god magics as much as to "surgically remove the evil," as Jeha puts it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jeha teaches her followers to focus on their main task, but to remove of evil should it become convenient.
