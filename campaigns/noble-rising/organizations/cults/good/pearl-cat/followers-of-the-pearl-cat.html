<h1>The Followers of the Pearl Cat</h1>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    The Followers of the Pearl Cat is a cult worshiping a pearl statue of a house cat, which is dedicated to the ideals of charity, kindness and teamwork.
    The cult consists of two priests, the original brother and sister twins that found the statue, with the rest of the followers being little more than
    disciples with their own personal interpretations of the Pearl Cat's teachings.
</p>
<p>
    The primary sacrifice to the Pearl Cat is small gems, which the Followers believe the statue eats when it comes to life at night.
