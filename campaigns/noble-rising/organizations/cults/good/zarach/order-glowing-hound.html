<h1>The Order of the Glowing Hound</h1>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    The Order of the Glowing Hound is a chivalric order that worships/follows the hound archon Zarach, devoted to the protection of the innocent via protecting
    vulnerable locations from evil. This can range from setting up fortifications, to physically defending an area, to weeding out corrupting in a local government,
    etc. Regardless of the form, the Order of the Glowing Hound puts protecting the innocent before destroying evil.

    Outside of their main fortress in XXX, where Zarach typically resides, the Order of the Glowing Hound operates in layers:

    The symbol of the Order of the Glowing Hound is a dog with a sun behind it, or in some groups a glowing aura emanating from it. Depictions range from
    the dog pointing like a pointer to the dog howling while standing on 2 legs.

    <li>If the innocent are protected, evil will starve.</li>

    The Order of the Glowing Hound is willing to work with almost anyone in the defense of the innocent, even evil organizations. However, the Order of the Glowing
    Hound believes <ap-link-button linkName="noble-muriels-cleansers">Muriel's Cleansers</ap-link-button> focus on hunting down evil over protecting the innocent is
    causing more harm than good.

    <h3>Zarach</h3>
    <p>
        Zarach is an improved hound archon who seeks to protect the innocent from danger. He uses his cultists to protect locations he believes will come under attack
        by dark forces.
    </p>
    <p>
        Zarach teaches his followers to protect the innocent over hunting down evil, as actively hunting down evil only serves to leave the innocent vulnerable to the forces
        of evil.
    </p>
    <p>
        Zarach dislikes Muriel, believing that her overly aggressive approach to dealing with evil does more harm than good and takes valuable guardians away from those who
        need them most.
