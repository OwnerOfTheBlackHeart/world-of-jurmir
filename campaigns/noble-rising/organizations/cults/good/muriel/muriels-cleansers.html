<h1>Muriel's Cleansers</h1>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Muriel's Cleansers is a cult worshipping the astral deva Muriel, whom they worship for her pure goodness. Outside of the two "branches," the Stalkers and the
    Wave, cult lacks any internal structure. The Stalkers, which make up the majority of the cult, are the hunters of the Cleansers that actively seek out and
    destroy evil, either on their own or in small teams. The Wave serves Muriel directly, serving both as her personal army and as keepers of her shrines and
    safe houses.
