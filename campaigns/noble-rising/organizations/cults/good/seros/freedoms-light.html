<h1>Freedom's Light</h1>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Freedom's Light is a cult worshipping the ghaele (eladrin) Seros, devoted to hunting down corruption and throwing off the chains of oppressors.
    Freedom's Light prefers to operate quietly, working to push good aligned leaders into power, assassinate evil leaders and support and guide well
    intentioned rebellions. Freedom's Light lacks any form of structure.

    Freedom's Light acts on their own most of the time, though they believe that the <ap-link-button linkName="noble-followers-of-the-pearl-cat">Followers of the Pearl Cat
    </ap-link-button> are wonderful, and support them whenever they can. While Freedom's Light believes that <ap-link-button linkName="noble-muriels-cleansers">Muriel's Cleansers
    </ap-link-button> methods are crude and blunt, they appreciate them and provide support when it won't cause collateral damage.
