<h1>The Second Order</h1>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    The Second Order is a cult worshipping the rakshasa Lecha, who guides the Second Order in a quest to tear down the current order (the First Order) and replace it
    with a second order, which Lecha will lead. The common claim is that all the world's problems boil down to the existing governments lacking the will to make decisive
    action, a flaw that Lecha doesn't have.
</p>
<p>
    The Second Order prefers to destroy existing governments through infiltrating them and putting in place laws that will eventually lead to chaos and their own demise.
</p>
<p>
    The Second Order rarely forms groups large enough for proper power structures to form, though they usually organize into a leader with actual political power
    commanding a network of trusted advisors, officers, spies, assassins, etc. Normally the person with political power is the one who leads their branch of
    the cult, though it isn't unheard of for a priest of Lecha to organize the grand plans of a branch with another person handling the role of the political
    leader.

    The Second Order is highly selective of who they work with, avoiding most cults, though they do work with <ap-link-button linkName="noble-ragrunnoths-ruminators">Ragrunnoth's

    <h3>Lecha</h3>
    <p>
        Lecha is a rakshasa who seeks to slowly tear down the current civilization and replace it with a system she controls. She uses her cultists to infiltrate governments
        and alter the laws to cause eventual chaos.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lecha teaches her servants that the problem with the current world is that the existing governments lack the will to make decisive action and would be better served
        by having Lecha rule them.
