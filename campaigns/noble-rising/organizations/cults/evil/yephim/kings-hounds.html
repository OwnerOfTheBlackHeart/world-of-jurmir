<h1>The King's Hounds</h1>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    The King's Hounds is a cult worshiping the nessian warhound (hell hound) Yephim, who seeks the dominance of the forces of 
    <ap-link-button linkName="hell">Hell</ap-link-button> and the return of the
    <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button>. The King's Hounds nip at the heels of the institutions that try to enforce goodness
    and those that try to prevent the return of the <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button>.
</p>
<p>
    The King's Hounds form small, well organized warbands that are typically lead by either a Howler (cleric) or a chieftain, which then breaks down into
    squads of 4 to 12 soldiers or conscripts commanded by a sergeant, who is always a trusted servant of the warband's leader. If a warband is successful
    enough for long enough, they may eventually form a tribe of anywhere from 100 to 600 members, with another 40% being noncombatants in the form of slaves
    and children.

    <li>Wasting subordinates is wasting the resources of Yephim himself.</li>
    <li>A member may never eat the meat of a dog.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The King's Hounds typically operate fast enough that they don't have time to interact with other cults, except those that oppose them. The Hounds don't like the
    <ap-link-button linkName="noble-calmers-of-the-flame-lord">Calmers of the Flame Lord</ap-link-button> or the <ap-link-button linkName="noble-servants-of-perfect-beauty">
    Servants of Perfect Beauty</ap-link-button>, because both lack a true, driving objective. 
</p>
<p>
    While the Hounds don't have any regular contact with the <ap-link-button linkName="noble-liberation-guild">Liberation Guild</ap-link-button>, they appreciate the
    idea of killing <ap-link-button linkName="sithrak">Sithrak</ap-link-button>. It doesn't hurt that killing <ap-link-button linkName="sithrak">Sithrak</ap-link-button>
    would greatly further the Hounds' goals.
</p>
<p>
    The Hounds view the <ap-link-button linkName="noble-fallenfeather-sisterhood">Fallenfeather Sisterhood</ap-link-button> with a mix of awe and disgust. They value the
    <ap-link-button linkName="noble-fallenfeather-sisterhood">Sisterhood's</ap-link-button> efficient organization, the individual member's skill and their objective of
    liberation from <ap-link-button linkName="hell">Hell</ap-link-button>. However, the Hounds find <ap-link-button linkName="noble-akkus">Akkus's</ap-link-button> lack
    of a big picture goal and refusal to join the forces of <ap-link-button linkName="hell">Hell</ap-link-button> highly offensive.

    <h3>Yephim, the Puppy of Doom</h3>
    <p>
        Yephim is a nessian warhound (hell hound) who seeks the dominance of the forces of <ap-link-button linkName="hell">Hell</ap-link-button> and of the 
        <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button>.
        Yephim uses his cult to wear down the will of the institutions that try to enforce goodness and that prevent 
        <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">the King's</ap-link-button> return.
    </p>
    <p>
        Yephim teaches his servants that power comes as much from sudden violence as careful, deliberate, and slow action.
