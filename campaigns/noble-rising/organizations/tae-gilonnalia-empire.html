<h1>The Tae`Gilonnalia Empire (Tay Gee-lo-nalia)</h1>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
	The empire that rules over Taaira-Ruzara and Tiathiloth, the Tae`Gilonnalia (Love Mistress Griffon Keeper) was once the 
	Pyro`ahal (Sapphire of the Subtle Summer) Matriarchy (a monarchy with an elected parliament of women), but after the 
	ascension of Queen Gilonna (Griffin Keeper), the youngest cousin of the previous Queen Venvyre, it has become the 
	Tae`Gilonnalia Empire.

	<p>
		Empress Gilonna achieved this by raising an army with the help of, and disguised as, the Hands of Kriotz. Using the 
		justification of finding human civilizations on the continent without the Human Curse, the Hands of Kriotz were able
		to hide the expansion of the then Queen's army and her support of the organization.

<h2>Important Persons</h2>
<h3>Empress Gilonna</h3>
<p>
	The current Empress.
</p>

<h2>Titles</h2>
<h3>Emperor/Empress</h3>
<p>
	The highest title in the Empire, the emperor or empress is in charge of the entire empire. The court of the Empress is
	the single most selective court in the land, so selective that the persons who are allowed entry usually have such 
	responsibility that they must send representatives instead. Any word spoken by the Empress is law and must be followed.
</p>
<p>
	The Empress rules the entire Empire and is in charge of assigning kings, queens, counts, and countesses. The Empress may
	also grant the title of Knight of the Empire, which is a special variation of the knight title that directly serves the
	Empress and is considered to be an extension of the Empress.
</p>

<h3>King/Queen</h3>
<p>
	The second highest noble title within the Empire, kings and queens rule over massive expanses of land. They are primarily
	administrative in nature, but there is only one to two people in the whole Empire that can override their commands. The
	courts of kings and queens are nearly sacred in how selective the people and issues that appear in court are.
</p>
<p>
	Kings rule kingdoms and queens rule queendoms, with both being in charge of assigning dukes, counts, barons, baronets,
	and knights, and administering dukes.
</p>

<h3>Prince/Princess</h3>
<p>
	A prince or princess is the child of a king, queen, emperor or empress. Princes typically have little official power, but
	due to the potential for them to become king/queen/emperor/empress, they tend to have no shortage of powerful suitors.
</p>
<p>
	Princes have no official responsibilities or powers, but they often have influence due to their lineage. Many are granted
	other titles or lands after they come of age.
</p>

<h3>Duke/Duchess</h3>
<p>
	Dukes and duchesses are the third highest ranking nobles in the Empire and rule over large, not always contiguous sections
	of land. 
</p>
<p>
	Dukes rule over duchies and are in charge of assigning barons, baronets, and knights and administering counts.
</p>

<h3>Marquess/Marchioness</h3>
<p>
	Marquesses and marchionesses are nobles in charge of frontier lands. Compared to other nobles, marquesses have significantly
	greater military forces.
</p>
<p>
	Marquesses rule over marks and are in charge of assigning barons, baronets, and knights, administering counts and building fortifications.
</p>

<h3>Count/Countess</h3>
<p>
	Sometimes known as Earl, a count or countess is typically given lands along with their title by the king/queen. On rare
	occasions, a count will be given the title without any land. Depending on the kingdom in which a count is given their
	title, it may, or may not, be hereditary.
</p>
<p>
	Counts who are given lands are in charge of counties and assigning out viscounts, barons, baronets, and knights.
</p>
<p>
	Counts who are not given lands are typically placed in charge of high level operations within a kingdom or duchy, such as
	collecting taxes from the counts, watching out for persons of high potential, managing spy rings, and more.
</p>

<h3>Viscount/Viscountess</h3>
<p>
	A viscount or viscountess is a militaristic noble title who serves as a sheriff for their count. Counts often appoint their
	children as viscounts, if they believe that they can trust them. Viscounts usually do not own land.
</p>
<p>
	Viscounts are in charge of enforcing the laws of the county, collecting taxes from the nobility, and managing the count's
	knights.
</p>

<h3>Baron/Baroness</h3>
<p>
	A baron/baroness is a title that is granted along with land ownership, usually as a reward for service. While the title is
	typically given out by a king or queen, counts and countesses may also give out the title. It is common for the title of
	baron to be given out for military service.
</p>
<p>
	Barons rule over baronies and are responsible for assigning out knights and lords.
</p>

<h3>Baronet/Baronetess</h3>
<p>
	A baronet/baronetess is a title that is granted along with land ownership, usually as a reward for service. While the title is
	typically given out by a king or queen, counts and countesses may also give out the title. Being that the title is typically
	a reward for service, it is common for barons to have been born a commoner.
</p>
<p>
	Baronets have the same rights and responsibilities as barons, but baronets are not typically allowed to participate in higher 
	courts without explicit permission.
</p>

<h3>Lord/Lady</h3>
<p>
	An honorary title that may be gained through land ownership, economic power, or noble lineage. Having this title allows
	one to earn a permanent seat within a noble's court and to participate in court discussions without express permission.
</p>
<p>
	The children of most nobility are a lord or a lady until they acquire a higher title. The exceptions are for the children
	of the emperor/empress and kings/queens, which become princes and princesses.
</p>

<h3>Knight/Dame</h3>
<p>
	A knight or dame is a bestowed title that happens under two circumstances: Either a person (commoner or noble)
	is accepted into a chivalric order or they are appointed knighthood by a land owner (typically a lord or baron).
	The titles of knight and dame are militaristic in nature.
</p>
<p>
	Knights that have been accepted into a chivalric order serve the order they were accepted into directly. This may
	be as personal body guards to the noble who created the order, overseeing mercenaries and commoners in the execution
	of an operation of the order, acting as special forces units, or otherwise performing actions that the order dictates.
</p>
<p>
	Land owning knights are given a small area of land, typically 1 to 4 settlements, and are in charge of assigning
	mayors and gathering, training, and leading troops. For 1 week out of every year, land owning knights are required
	to personally serve their king and/or queen, typically by guarding them along with 10 to 40 of the knight's finest
	troops.
</p>

<h3>Mayor</h3>
<p>
	A mayor is an official elected by a knight or dame to handled the day to day operations of a settlement.
	Mayors don't own any land and can be removed from office, or otherwise replaced, at any time. They are
	often chosen from trusted commoners. Most settlements have a mayor.
</p>
<p>
	Mayors handle day to day operations, including, but not limited to, assigning/acting as judges, handling resource allocation, collecting
	taxes, interpreting laws and ensuring the readiness of conscripted soldiers.
