<h1>The Tae`Gilonnalia Empire</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	The empire that rules over Taaira-Ruzara and Tiathiloth, the Tae`Gilonnalia (Love Mistress Griffon Keeper) was once the 
	Pyro`ahal (Sapphire of the Subtle Summer) Matriarchy (a monarchy with an elected parliament of women), but after the 
	ascension of Queen Gilonna (Griffin Keeper), the youngest cousin of the previous Queen Venvyre, it has become the 
	Tae`Gilonnalia Empire.
</p>
<p>
	Empress Gilonna achieved this by raising an army with the help of, and disguised as, the Hands of Kriotz. Using the 
	justification of finding human civilizations on the continent without the Human Curse, the Hands of Kriotz were able
	to hide the expansion of the then Queen's army and her support of the organization.
