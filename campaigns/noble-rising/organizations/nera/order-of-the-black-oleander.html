<ap-auth-container permissions="gm black-oleander-full noble-full rorshana-history">

		Originally born the 5th child to a minor lord who barely owned a small village, Rorshana was noble only in name and had to seek her own path

        <ap-link-button linkName="noble-forslag">Forslag</ap-link-button>, who had no need of an untested lower noble trying to become a knight. 
        With few other options, Rorshana returned to her father to get some level of combat training, proving herself capable during a peasant rebellion
        that had managed to hire several slayers under the table, though even this wasn't enough for the baron of northern

		Born in the hamlet of <ap-link-button linkName="noble-silverwood">Silverwood</ap-link-button>, Kira found it difficult to connect with people when every

		Dirris was once the apprentice of Voczec, though she found herself more interested in focusing on combative magics than on developing a wide repertoire of
        spells. Voczec wasn't angered by this, and decided to maintain his relationship with Dirris, though altering it to one where she was a general subordinate.
        Now, Dirris sees herself tasked with performing tasks for Voczec that he doesn't trust mercenaries, slayers, or castle staff to do, such as retrieving specific
        arcane materials.

<ap-auth-container permissions="gm black-oleander-full noble-full lelea-history">
	<p>
		Born on the desert side of the Craglorn Mountains, Lelea found herself not fitting in with the goliaths surrounding her, more interested with art, song,
        history, and frivolous hobbies than the typical goliath's allows for. After having a long talk with one of her tribe's elders, Lelea came to the conclusion
        that the best path for her was to leave her tribe willingly and travel into the lands of other races, where her interests didn't put those around her in
        danger. After a short look around <ap-link-button linkName="noble-mam-daruhm">Mam Daruhm</ap-link-button>, Lelea found that becoming a slayer would allow
        her to see and hear many things, make "easy" coin, and wander semi-aimlessly, so she joined the Slayer's Guild. During her time in the Slayer's Guild,
        she ended up attracting the attention of <ap-link-button linkName="noble-reth-mailynath">Reth'Mailynath</ap-link-button>, who was interested in what a
        such an oddly dressed goliath was doing. With her vibrant personality and <ap-link-button linkName="noble-reth-mailynath">Reth's</ap-link-button> vast
        catalog of stories and seemingly endless knowledge, the two became quick friends.
