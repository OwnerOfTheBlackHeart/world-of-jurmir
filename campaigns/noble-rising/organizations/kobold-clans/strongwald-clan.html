<h1>Strongwald Kobold Clan</h1>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>
	Built into an offshoot of the Craglorn Mountains, the Strongwald burrow's entrance is hidden by mountain rocks and forest trees.
	Given the mobile and offensive nature of the fighters of the Strongwald clan, their burrow's entrance uses few traps, primarily
	pitfalls and oil traps. Instead, the Strongwalds prefer to hide behind captured, and trained in some cases, beasts that are kept
	just hungry enough to attack anything that passes by them.
</p>
<p>
	The actual entrance of the Strongwald burrow is hidden to the north of the "main" entrance, within the Strongwald Valley. The
	actual entrance is then hidden further by three large boulders that are moved using tamed cave triceratops. Kobolds can enter
	and exit the trapped entrance via trapdoors in the ceiling, and floors in certain rooms.
</p>

<h2>Temperament</h2>
<p>
	The Strongwald clan does not normally tolerate the presence of others, as doing such hinders their holy mission. That is, unless
	the others in question are dragons or bear the blood of dragons, in which case the kobolds of Strongwald will often provide what
	aid they can without interfering with their holy mission or the horde of Kyranious. While they haven't had a run in with a dragon,
	if they do and the dragon declares the horde within the kobolds' temple to be its, they will make quick enemies of the Strongwald
	clan as they are clearly heretics if they believe they can steal from the horde of the dragon goddess herself.
</p>

<h2>Greatest Objective</h2>
<p>
	The Strongwald clan is the most zealous of the nearby kobold clans, seeing the worship of Kyranious as the reason for their
	entire existence. To them, aiding dragons and those descended from dragons is a part of their holy calling, as is hunting down
	and killing "fake" dragons, such as hydras and drakes. The individual kobolds of the Strongwald clan do not horde valuable
	metals or gems, as anything of value that can't be used to further the will of Kyranious goes into the horde built into her
	temple within their burrow. When praying to Kyranious, the kobolds of Strongwald kneel upon her horde as they are just another
	part of it.
