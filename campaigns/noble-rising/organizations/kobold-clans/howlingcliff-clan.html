<h1>Howlingcliff Kobold Clan (Kingdom of Howlingcliff)</h1>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>
	Built at the lowest peak of the Howling Peaks and appearing as if the entrance was a fortified cave.
	The fortifications at the front are boulders that have had snipers nests and arrow slots carved into them.
	The trapped entrance to the Howlingcliff clan burrow is designed to allow the kobolds to harass, with many
	arrow slits, trap doors, and manually triggered traps, all of which can only be accessed from within the
	burrow.
</p>
<p>
	Kobolds of the Howlingcliff clan enter through the normal entrance and are allowed through by "commandos"
	into the clan entrance behind the false horde.
</p>

<h2>Temperament</h2>
<p>
	The Howlingcliff clan treats itself like a proper government with a standing army.
</p>

<h2>Greatest Objective</h2>
<p>
	The kobolds of the Howlingcliff clan wish to be accepted as a legitimate nation, and to become truly 
	self-sufficient (have a controlled source of food, etc.).
</p>

<h2>Interactions</h2>
<p>
	Told of Elderfield and Cherryvale, established a deal to slowly grow Howlingcliff's forces. They have given Nera 6 kobolds, 1 runner
	kobold, and Mex (see roll20).
