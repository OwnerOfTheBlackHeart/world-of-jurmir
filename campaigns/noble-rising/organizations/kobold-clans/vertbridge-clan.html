<h1>Vertbridge Kobold Clan</h1>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>
	The burrow of the Vertbridge clan is located about 2 miles from the Vert Bridge that connects the Mount
	of Decay to the grasslands to it's north. The entrance is hidden close the to the river that flows down 
	from the mountain and is guarded by a large trap dungeon with a couple of capture monsters for effect.
	The kobolds enter using hidden panels in the floor.
</p>

<h2>Temperament</h2>
<p>
	The Vertbridge clan is a stereotypical clan, with a generally distrustful to violent reaction towards any
	creature that isn't at least partially dragon. They are openly hostile towards gnomes, but gnomes with
	enough dragon blood in them will be viewed as creatures that are untrustworthy.
</p>

<h2>Greatest Objective</h2>
<p>
	As the Vertbridge clan is the pinicle of being kobolds, they posses three great callings: To find a dragon to
	serve under, to exterminate gnomes and to exterminate dwarves. However, they rarely have the bravery to even
	attempt any of the three.
