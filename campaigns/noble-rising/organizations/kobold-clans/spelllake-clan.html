<h1>Spelllake Kobold Clan</h1>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>
	The Spelllake kobold clan makes their burrow in the hilly forest to the southwest of Spelllake and the Eight Great Towers, 
	built under the largest tree for miles around. The entrance is disguised as a cave beneath the tree, with small view ports
	carved into the stone that are disguised with an illusion spell. A 6' 6" door that leads to the trap entrance is also covered
	by an illusion spell.
</p>
<p>
	If the kobolds on watch see a creature they wish to let in, they will mechanically open a section of stone large enough for a wagon to fit
	through. If they are unsure, but want to send out a representative, the kobold chosen will then exit using the door that leads
	to the trapped entrance. The kobolds that work the watch holes typically use crossbows and may have a sorcerer on hand.
</p>
<p>
	The trapped entrance of the Spelllake clan is made of magically carved hallways and rooms that descends 20 feet deeper into the stone.
	Most of the traps in the trapped entrance are magical, however there are several hallways with oil canals and plenty of arrowslits
	along the walls.
</p>

<h2>Temperament</h2>
<p>
	The Spelllake clan is in a "competition" with the wizards of the Eight Great Towers, despite the wizards not even being aware of the
	Spelllake clan. The Spelllake clan, despite their competition, works through disguises to make sure that they go undiscovered by the
	bigger folk, usually through trade and the manipulation of the laws of the big folk.
</p>

<h2>Greatest Objective</h2>
<p>
	The powerful blood of the dragon is that which powers the magics of the Spelllake clan and which is the source of their great focus:
	To draw out the dragon within them through their magics and to make the most of their inner dragon.

<p>
	Eltu is a 2' 4" tall, aging, male kobold with dull reddish-black scales, a pair of bone ridges that look like small mohawks behind each eye,

	that he uses as a cane. Eltu wears a golden ring on each finger, with the following gems embedded in each ring, in order: pink diamond, emerald,
	aquamarine, garnet, red spinel, moonstone, amber, golden yellow topaz, white opal, and zircon.
</p>
<p>
	Elder Eltu is the eldest sorcerer of the Spelllake Clan and is often serves as a "High Sorcerer" of sorts, helping other sorcerers with ensuring
	their proposals are accurate and of appropriate quality before they are presented to the All Watcher as well as aiding in the administration of

	that involve sorcerers.

<h3 id="elder-gos">Elder Gos</h3>
<p>
	Gos is a 2' 8" tall, aging, male kobold with dark brown scales, a set of 8 thagomizers, 4 on each side and not big enough to be used as weapons, on the

	Gos gave up on wearing jewelry years ago.
</p>
<p>
	Elder Gos is the eldest eggkeeper in the Spelllake Clan and often serves as a foreman of sorts, keeping track of which eggs are where, which eggs have
	hatched, when each egg was laid and when was the last time that the fire was fed fuel. Due to his advancing age, Gos rarely tends the eggs himself, instead
	handling the records of the eggkeepers, and occasionally reporting to <a href="#all-watcher-zor">All Watcher Zor</a> when needed.
</p>
