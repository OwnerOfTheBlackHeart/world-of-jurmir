<h1>Spelllake Kobold Clan</h1>
<h2>Location</h2>
<p>
	The Spelllake kobold clan makes their burrow in the hilly forest to the southwest of Spelllake and the Eight Great Towers, 
	built under the largest tree for miles around. The entrance is disguised as a cave beneath the tree, with small view ports
	carved into the stone that are disguised with an illusion spell. A 6' 6" door that leads to the trap entrance is also covered
	by an illusion spell.
</p>
<p>
	If the kobolds on watch see a creature they wish to let in, they will mechanically open a section of stone large enough for a wagon to fit
	through. If they are unsure, but want to send out a representative, the kobold chosen will then exit using the door that leads
	to the trapped entrance. The kobolds that work the watch holes typically use crossbows and may have a sorcerer on hand.
</p>
<p>
	The trapped entrance of the Spelllake clan is made of magically carved hallways and rooms that descends 20 feet deeper into the stone.
	Most of the traps in the trapped entrance are magical, however there are several hallways with oil canals and plenty of arrowslits
	along the walls.
</p>

<h2>Temperament</h2>
<p>
	The Spelllake clan is in a "competition" with the wizards of the Eight Great Towers, despite the wizards not even being aware of the
	Spelllake clan. The Spelllake clan, despite their competition, works through disguises to make sure that they go undiscovered by the
	bigger folk, usually through trade and the manipulation of the laws of the big folk.
</p>

<h2>Greatest Objective</h2>
<p>
	The powerful blood of the dragon is that which powers the magics of the Spelllake clan and which is the source of their great focus:
	To draw out the dragon within them through their magics and to make the most of their inner dragon.
