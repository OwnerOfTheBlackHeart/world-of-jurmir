<h2>Notable Peoples</h2>
<h3>Nasshurr Diving Hawk</h3>
<p>
	Nasshurr is a tall (6' 9") and muscular catfolk who looks similar to a panther. He keeps his hair shoulder length
	in a braided ponytail and his fur shiny. He typically wears brown bear furs when he isn't wearing a cheap set of
	canvas work clothes with a leather apron.
</p>
<p>
	Nasshurr is not the friendliest catfolk on the planet and prefers to be left alone while he works at the forge... 
	unless business is involved. Nasshurr always has time for business.
</p>

<h3><ap-link-button linkName="noble-fang-img">Fang</ap-link-button></h3>
<p>
	Fang is a medium sized dog with a thick golden coat and soft, pointed ears. Unlike his master, Nasshurr, Fang loves
	people and is more than happy to talk, gossip, and receive all the pets he is allowed in a day. Fang does not wear 
	clothes, but he does have an enchanted collar with a green gem in it that allows Fang to speak and use 2 spectral
	hands.
</p>

<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h3>Hawk and Fang Goods</h3>
<p>
	Hawk and Fang Goods is a general and adventuring goods store which sells mundane, trade, and basic alchemical goods.
	It is owned by Nasshurr Diving Hawk, but the front is normally staffed by Fang, who happily greets anyone who walks
	in the door.
</p>
<p>
	While Hawk and Fang Goods appears as a small shop from the front, it is actually closer to an emporium with a large
	main room that Fang can easily watch over from the elevated counter that houses the vast majority of the goods. At
	the back of the main room is a door which leads to the smithy where Nasshurr is typically working and where most of
	the armor and weapons are located.
