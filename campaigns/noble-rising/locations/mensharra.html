<h2>Organizations and Monsters</h2>
<h3>The Slayers' Guild</h3>
<p>
	The Slayers' Guild is an organization responsible for managing a social caste known as "slayers" who are hired to
	kill monsters, criminals, and enemies of the state or retrieve objects from monsters and/or dungeons. All legitimate
	slayer jobs in Mensharra go through the Slayers' Guild and only those who are registered guild members may accept
	such work. While criminal slayers do operate within Mensharra, they are most often members of the Slayers' Guild
	who aren't picky about their employers.
</p>
<p>
	Due to the prominent economic position of slayers, the selection of which jobs are prioritized is a source of power,
	as is the ability to "deploy" slayers to cause/redirect problems. This position of power allows the Slayers' Guild
	to bully local businesses, and some nobles, into actions that benefit the guild or its benefactors. The Slayers'
	Guild is able to survive without legal repercussion primarily because of their good standing with Count Black.
</p>
<p>
	Within the Slayer's Guild there are several grades of slayer, based off of the usefulness of the material in weapons.
	The highest rank is adamantine, of which there is currently only 5 active adamantine grade slayers, then is mithral,
	of which only 23 active mithral grade slayers, then steel, then iron, which is the grade most slayers will reach over 
	their careers, then bronze, copper, stone, and finally the starting rank of wood. There is also 2 honorable ranks,
	gold, which indicates that a person is a frequent bringer of jobs, and platinum, which only Count Black and the
	headmaster of the Slayer's Guild hold.
</p>

<h2>Notable Peoples</h2>
<h3>Nasshurr Diving Hawk</h3>
<p>
	Nasshurr is a tall (6' 9") and muscular catfolk who looks similar to a panther. He keeps his hair shoulder length
	in a braided ponytail and his fur shiny. He typically wears brown bear furs when he isn't wearing a cheap set of
	canvas work clothes with a leather apron.
</p>
<p>
	Nasshurr is not the friendliest catfolk on the planet and prefers to be left alone while he works at the forge... 
	unless business is involved. Nasshurr always has time for business.
</p>

<h3><ap-link-button linkName="noble-fang-img">Fang</ap-link-button></h3>
<p>
	Fang is a medium sized dog with a thick golden coat and soft, pointed ears. Unlike his master, Nasshurr, Fang loves
	people and is more than happy to talk, gossip, and receive all the pets he is allowed in a day. Fang does not wear 
	clothes, but he does have an enchanted collar with a green gem in it that allows Fang to speak and use 2 spectral
	hands.
</p>

<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h3>The Slayer's Guildhall</h3>
<p>
	The guildhall of the Slayer's Guild was built from the original castle of the slayer Count Therrass Black, the father
	of the current Count Black. The castle itself if made of trees grown together by druids from all over the Count's lands
	and has since been enchanted to be under the effects of a constant ironwood spell. The main complex is surrounded by
	a 20 foot tall stone wall that is manned by slayers unable to take work. The guildhall does not have a moat around its
	walls and sits on the eastern wall of Mensharra.
</p>
<p>
	The castle that makes up the Slayer's Guildhall is made up of four distinct sections that form a cross with 2 rear 
	courtyards and a large front courtyard. The rear section of	the castle holds the sleeping quarter's for the adamantine 
	and platinum grade guild members as well as the vault where	the guild's money and job rewards are stored. The front 
	section is a single, massive room adorned with trophies from slayers past and present, with the biggest being the
	head of an ancient gold dragon killed by Therrass Black himself. The front room is mainly used for guild gatherings
	and for job postings, with boards for each grade. The left hand section, from the entrance gate, holds the offices
	where the administration of the guild happens, from accepting new jobs to answering slayers' questions. The right
	section, from the entrance gate, holds the barracks where slayers who don't own their own homes live as well as the
	kitchen and several training and meeting rooms where the slayers can gain new skills or plan for jobs.
</p>
<p>
	The front courtyard of the guildhall is a beautiful grove kept up by the druids within, or hired by, the guild. The
	courtyard behind the offices is a bush garden with several chairs, benches, and tables that the guild's administrators
	can use to relax or work comfortably with customer or gold members. The courtyard behind the barracks has 6 long tables
	where guild members can eat in peace as well as several dummies that guild members can practice on.
</p>
<h3>Hawk and Fang Goods</h3>
<p>
	Hawk and Fang Goods is a general and adventuring goods store which sells mundane, trade, and basic alchemical goods.
	It is owned by Nasshurr Diving Hawk, but the front is normally staffed by Fang, who happily greets anyone who walks
	in the door.
</p>
<p>
	While Hawk and Fang Goods appears as a small shop from the front, it is actually closer to an emporium with a large
	main room that Fang can easily watch over from the elevated counter that houses the vast majority of the goods. At
	the back of the main room is a door which leads to the smithy where Nasshurr is typically working and where most of
	the armor and weapons are located.
