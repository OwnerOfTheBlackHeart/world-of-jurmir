<h3>Arthur's Swordworks</h3>
<p>
	Owned by the human smith Arthur, this large mud brick building is about the size of a great hall and is filled with
	swords of all sizes and shapes: Curved, straight, single and double edged, short, long and great, and even more.

<h3>Eye of Newt</h3>
<p>
	A simple white mud building that offers a weaved twig front door. Entering the shop reveals a gnome (no one has seen 
	the same gnome twice) sitting in a soft chair with a table and second chair for customers. The shelves are made of
	magically carved stone that has been enchanted so that only the currently working gnome can remove objects from them.
