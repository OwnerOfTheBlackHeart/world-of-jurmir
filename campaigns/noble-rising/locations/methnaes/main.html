    Duchess <a href="#eclavna-ichiir">Eclavna Ichiir</a> has sought to use the recent political changes within the empire to stake a larger claim
    for herself. To do this, Duchess <a href="#eclavna-ichiir">Ichiir</a> has begun a series of wars to take as much land from her neighboring 
    counties/duchies as possible to create a queendom of her own, Chalfryn'breena (meaning stable weapon of the matriarch). Much to her annoyance,
    many of her subordinates and citizens refer to Chalfryn'breena as Greater Methnaes.

<p>
    Duchess Eclavna Ichiir is a female drow who stands at 5' 1" tall with black skin, violet tinted white hair and dark red
    eyes. She typically wears a dress made from gossamer-like golden spider silk with strands of silver and gold woven in with
    rubies and sapphires dotted throughout the dress. Visible underneath the dress is a pair of silver silk panties and a silver
    silk corset with no fabric between the ribs. On the jewelry end, Duchess Ichiir prefers diamond studded platinum, with 2
    sets of ear rings, 3 to 5 necklaces (depending on the day), and a ring on every finger of her left hand. 
</p>
<p>
    Duchess Ichiir is a results driven ruler and treats people based on how useful they have been, or could be, to her. She
    is willing to accept the occasional failure, usually as a "learning opportunity," but repeated failures will earn her
    wrath.
</p>
<p>
    The Duchess has her eyes on moving up in rank to a queen, and she sees Taaira Ruzara as one step in acquiring enough land
    to form her holdings into a queendom.
