<p>
    Located halfway up Mount Neenlin and hidden at the end of a valley formed by the mountains Talaka and Xulllace, is the metropolis
    of Barakuir. Barakuir is built half inside and half on the surface of Mount Neelin, with a large stone wall protecting the surface
    portion of Barakuir. Water within Barakuir is drawn from an underground river and magically pumped up into the city, then distributed
    through a series of stone channels from inside the mountain to outside the walls into the surrounding farms.
</p>
<p>
    The underground portion of Barakuir is primarily home to drow, though dwarves and other underground dwellers make their home within.
    While not nicer in total when compared to the outside portion of Barakuir, the underground portion has a much harsher divide between
    the "classes," with slums being carved lower than the higher class residences.
</p>
<p>
    The surface portion of Barakuir is the most densely populated portion of Barakuir, housing markets, apartments, bars, pubs, inns,
    stables, and everything else needed for a thriving metropolis. The poor, middle class, and wealthy portions of the surface portion
    of Barakuir blend seamlessly together, with a mostly equal mix of surface races, though humans can have a little more trouble 
    getting settled into Barakuir permanently.

<h3 id="wives-of-sithrak">The Wives of Sithrak</h3>
<p>
    Made up exclusively of female drow, the Wives of Sithrak exist to ensure the worship of Sithrak and to suppress, and destroy, cults to
    minor gods within <ap-link-button linkName="noble-methnaes">Methnaes</ap-link-button>. While the Wives of Sithrak prefer to use their
    authority as drow women and priestesses of <ap-link-button linkName="sithrak">Sithrak</ap-link-button> to perform their duties openly,
    the Wives are more than capable of using subtlety to accomplish their objectives or to gain political power.
</p>
<p>
    While the Wives of Sithrak technically operate all throughout <ap-link-button linkName="noble-methnaes">Methnaes</ap-link-button>,
    their <a href="#sithraks-harem">headquarters</a> in Barakuir is where the highest density of Wives operate and where they posses the

<h3 id="titan-towers-productions">Titan Towers Productions</h3>
<p>
    Titan Towers Productions is a troupe of bards who perform anything from plays to concerts to dances, all with the added flair of
    bardic magic. Their ability to use bardic magic to make realistic and fantastic performances, as well as the the low ticket prices,
    has made Titan Towers Productions highly popular among the populace of Barakuir.
</p>
<p>
    The symbol of Titan Towers Productions is a titan climbing two towers.

    Titan Towers Productions is based out of the <a href="#titan-towers-productions-headquarters">Titan Towers Productions Headquarters</a>.

        Titan Towers Productions wields both economic and political power, with the ability to build and destroy reputations, plant ideas in
        the minds of the populace, and other social tricks. For the most part, Titan Towers Productions is more than happy to sustain itself
        off of "sponsored" performances, however TTP becomes very aggressive when other bard troupes attempt to setup shop within Barakuir,
        either driving them out or absorbing them into Titan Towers Productions. TTP also doesn't tolerate particularly skilled professional
        performers that aren't a part of their troupe.

    massive amphitheatre with carefully tuned acoustics, rentable meeting rooms, a practice stage, acoustically tuned practice rooms, and

    awe and wealth. The headquarters is located at the meeting point of the surface and underground sections of Barakuir, allowing the light-sensitive
    citizens to comfortably catch daytime performances thanks to a shaded walkway from the exit to the surface.

<h4 id="castle-ichiir">Castle Ichiir</h4>
<p>
    Seated at the highest tier of the underground portion of Barakuir, Castle Ichiir is a 7 story tall castle carved from stone with defensive walls
    and towers that protect both the castle itself and its 2 baileys. Within the baileys are the housing and smithies that support Castle Ichiir's staff
    and guards, while the keep of the castle is surrounded by a large, decorative mushroom garden and a food garden.
</p>
<p>
    The inside of Castle Ichiir is kept immaculate and has themed rooms throughout the castle, 12 sitting rooms, a great hall, a ballroom, an arcane lab,
    seemingly countless decorations, and a gallery containing art, and other decorations, that don't have a place in any of the themed rooms. Servants and
    slaves scurry about Castle Ichiir seemly constantly, going about their various duties.

<p>
    Located deep within Barakuir's underground section, Sithrak's Harem is a 4 story, stone church built into the rear wall of Barakuir. The building
    is only accessible to the wives or fiancées (recruits), though it is rumored to be lavish within and to have a sprawling network of secret tunnels
    leading throughout Barakuir. A single room, a well kept and furnished hall lined with small booths that are a mix between a teller's booth and a
    confession booth, is the only room of Sithrak's Harem open to the public, allowing them to report suspicious activity to the 
    <a href="#wives-of-sithrak">Wives of Sithrak</a> without anyone else hearing what was said.

    carpets, patterned wall tapestries, upholstered chairs and couches, and carved busts of drow matrons. Ko'ar Manor has slightly less servants than one
    would expect for a mansion of its size.

<h4 id="pit-market">The Pit Market</h4>
<p>
    Taking up the lowest tier of Barakuir's underground portion, the Pit Market is the "drows' market" where just about any mundane vice can be purchased,
    from drugs and poisons to whores and slaves. The market itself is made primarily of light wooden booths and cart-shops that can be quickly and easily moved
    as merchants and traders come and go, all centered around the slave market itself, which is a circle of cage-carts and slave merchants surrounding a large 
    stage made from wood-like mushroom planks that serves as a display for slaves on auction as well as the gallows when called for.
</p>
<p>
    Drow and duergars make up most of the visitors to the Pit Market, as the other residents would rather not risk becoming goods. A surprising number of well
    dressed, and thoroughly guarded, individuals visit the market, despite the need to pass through the slums of Barakuir to reach the Pit Market.

    The Pit Market is owned and managed by <a href="#valatar-hunath">Valatar Hun'ath</a>.
