<p>
    Titan Towers Productions is a troupe of bards who perform anything from plays to concerts to dances, all with the added flair of
    bardic magic. Their ability to use bardic magic to make realistic and fantastic performances, as well as the the low ticket prices,
    has made Titan Towers Productions highly popular among the populace of Barakuir.
</p>
<p>
    The symbol of Titan Towers Productions is a titan climbing two towers.

    <p>
        Titan Towers Productions wields both economic and political power, with the ability to build and destroy reputations, plant ideas in
        the minds of the populace, and other social tricks. For the most part, Titan Towers Productions is more than happy to sustain itself
        off of "sponsored" performances, however TTP becomes very aggressive when other bard troupes attempt to setup shop within Barakuir,
        either driving them out or absorbing them into Titan Towers Productions. TTP also doesn't tolerate particularly skilled professional
        performers that aren't a part of their troupe.

        Rynrin is somewhat of a hero locally thanks to having served in the methnain army as a powerful war caster and having personally defended
        Barakuir from siege 22 years ago. Nowadays she uses her accrued wealth and influence to try and protect the less powerful and the less fortunate,
        through strictly legal means as Rynrin honestly believes that all the government needs is a few good pushes to be much better.
