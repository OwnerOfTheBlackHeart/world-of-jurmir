<p>
    Located halfway up Mount Neenlin and hidden at the end of a valley formed by the mountains Talaka and Xulllace, is the metropolis
    of Barakuir. Barakuir is built half inside and half on the surface of Mount Neelin, with a large stone wall protecting the surface
    portion of Barakuir. Water within Barakuir is drawn from an underground river and magically pumped up into the city, then distributed
    through a series of stone channels from inside the mountain to outside the walls into the surrounding farms.
</p>
<p>
    The underground portion of Barakuir is primarily home to drow, though dwarves and other underground dwellers make their home within.
    While not nicer in total when compared to the outside portion of Barakuir, the underground portion has a much harsher divide between
    the "classes," with slums being carved lower than the higher class residences.
</p>
<p>
    The surface portion of Barakuir is the most densely populated portion of Barakuir, housing markets, apartments, bars, pubs, inns,
    stables, and everything else needed for a thriving metropolis. The poor, middle class, and wealthy portions of the surface portion
    of Barakuir blend seamlessly together, with a mostly equal mix of surface races, though humans can have a little more trouble 
    getting settled into Barakuir permanently.

<h2 id="organizations-and-monsters">Organizations and Monsters</h2>
<h3 id="wives-of-sithrak">The Wives of Sithrak</h3>
<p>
    Made up exclusively of female drow, the Wives of Sithrak exist to ensure the worship of Sithrak and to suppress, and destroy, cults to
    minor gods within <ap-link-button linkName="noble-methnaes">Methnaes</ap-link-button>. While the Wives of Sithrak prefer to use their
    authority as drow women and priestesses of <ap-link-button linkName="sithrak">Sithrak</ap-link-button> to perform their duties openly,
    the Wives are more than capable of using subtlety to accomplish their objectives or to gain political power.
</p>
<p>
    While the Wives of Sithrak technically operate all throughout <ap-link-button linkName="noble-methnaes">Methnaes</ap-link-button>,
    their <a href="#sithraks-harem">headquarters</a> in Barakuir is where the highest density of Wives operate and where they posses the
    greatest influence.

<h3 id="titan-towers-productions">Titan Towers Productions</h3>
<p>
    Titan Towers Productions is a troupe of bards who perform anything from plays to concerts to dances, all with the added flair of
    bardic magic. Their ability to use bardic magic to make realistic and fantastic performances, as well as the the low ticket prices,
    has made Titan Towers Productions highly popular among the populace of Barakuir.
</p>
<p>
    The symbol of Titan Towers Productions is a titan climbing two towers.
</p>
<p>
    Titan Towers Productions is based out of the <a href="#titan-towers-productions-headquarters">Titan Towers Productions Headquarters</a>.

    <p>
        Titan Towers Productions wields both economic and political power, with the ability to build and destroy reputations, plant ideas in
        the minds of the populace, and other social tricks. For the most part, Titan Towers Productions is more than happy to sustain itself
        off of "sponsored" performances, however TTP becomes very aggressive when other bard troupes attempt to setup shop within Barakuir,
        either driving them out or absorbing them into Titan Towers Productions. TTP also doesn't tolerate particularly skilled professional
        performers that aren't a part of their troupe.

<h3 id="triele-koar">Mayor Triele Ko'ar</h3>
<p>
    Triele is a 5' tall, female drow with pale lavender hair that flows down to her waist, purple-gray skin that is quite fair for a drow,
    dark red eyes, C cup titties, and a slim build. Triele normally wears an outfit made of black leather straps so supple that her nipple
    and clit piercings are visible through it. The visible jewelry that Triele wears a pair of onyx studs in her left ear and a silver bracer
    embedded with freshwater pearls.
</p>

<p>
    Rynrin is a 4' 2" tall, female dwarf with graying brown hair kept in a long ponytail that goes down to the small of the back before splitting into
    three smaller braids which drape down to her ass, light brown skin, dark brown eyes, C cup titties and a fat build. Rynrin normally wears vibrant
    orange and yellow robes with heavy gold jewelry and a sturdy ironwood staff (which was a gift).
</p>
<p>
    Rynrin lives in <a href="#rynrins-mansion">Rynrin's Mansion</a>, from which she lobbies for the downtrodden.
</p>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm noble-full rynrin-hokan-background">
    <p>
        Rynrin is somewhat of a hero locally thanks to having served in the methnain army as a powerful war caster and having personally defended
        Barakuir from siege 22 years ago. Nowadays she uses her accrued wealth and influence to try and protect the less powerful and the less fortunate,
        through strictly legal means as Rynrin honestly believes that all the government needs is a few good pushes to be much better.

<h3 id="castle-ichiir">Castle Ichiir</h3>
<p>
    Seated at the highest tier of the underground portion of Barakuir, Castle Ichiir is a 7 story tall castle carved from stone with defensive walls
    and towers that protect both the castle itself and its 2 baileys. Within the baileys are the housing and smithies that support Castle Ichiir's staff
    and guards, while the keep of the castle is surrounded by a large, decorative mushroom garden and a food garden.
</p>
<p>
    The inside of Castle Ichiir is kept immaculate and has themed rooms throughout the castle, 12 sitting rooms, a great hall, a ballroom, an arcane lab,
    seemingly countless decorations, and a gallery containing art, and other decorations, that don't have a place in any of the themed rooms. Servants and
    slaves scurry about Castle Ichiir seemly constantly, going about their various duties.

<h3 id="sithraks-harem">Sithrak's Harem</h3>
<p>
    Located deep within Barakuir's underground section, Sithrak's Harem is a 4 story, stone church built into the rear wall of Barakuir. The building
    is only accessible to the wives or fiancées (recruits), though it is rumored to be lavish within and to be have a sprawling network of secret tunnels
    leading throughout Barakuir. A single room, a well kept and furnished hall lined with small booths that are a mix between a teller's booth and a
    confession booth, is the only room of Sithrak's Harem open to the public, allowing them to report suspicious activity to the 
    <a href="#wives-of-sithrak">Wives of Sithrak</a> without anyone else hearing what was said.

    Ko'ar Manor is a 2 story, carved stone building in the raised, wealthy district within the underground section of Barakuir. Relatively plain on the

    carpets, patterned wall tapestries, upholstered chairs and couches, and carved busts of drow matrons. Ko'ar Manor has slightly less servants than one
    would expect for a mansion of its size.

    awe and wealth. The headquarters is located at the meeting point of the surface and underground sections of Barakuir, allowing the light-sensitive
    citizens to comfortably catch daytime performances thanks to a shaded walkway from the exit to the surface.

    nice, hotel-like rooms with a bed, small desk, sitting chair and chamber pot each that are offered to the homeless and recently dispossessed.
