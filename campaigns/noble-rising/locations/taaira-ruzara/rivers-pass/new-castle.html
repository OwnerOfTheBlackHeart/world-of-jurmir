<p>
    Castle Raging Wolf is a "permanent" residence of <a href="#diha-raging-wolf">Countess Diha Raging Wolf</a> within New Castle.
    Located on the northeastern side of the estuary, the castle itself is 2 stories of round stone with a further 2 stories of wooden scaffolding, 
    with a 6 boat dock, an oversized courtyard, and a mud wall (with a round stone wall being built behind it). 
</p>
<p>
    The first floor has 5 rooms: A fairly simple kitchen without any permanent structures, a guard's office where the guard captain typically works
    with a stairway to the dungeons, a waiting room with 2 couches with coffee tables and a large rug, a great hall with half of the typical number
    of tables and benches, and a meeting room with a nice, purple chair, two couches and a center table. The second floor houses 
    <a href="#diha-raging-wolf">Countess Diha's</a> private rooms: A master bedroom, 2 guest rooms, a room with a loom, spinning wheel, tinderframe
    and other fabric/clothes making machines, a den/library and a display room filled with mannequin's wearing clothes made from exotic materials.
</p>
<p>
    Two basement entrances exist: One in the "kitchen" and the other in the guard captain's office. The entrance in the kitchen leads to an ice room
    and a larder, while the entrance beneath the guard captain's office leads to a dungeon made up of a single hallway with 3 cells on either side.
