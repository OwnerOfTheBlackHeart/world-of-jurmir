	<h2>GM Notes</h2>
	<p>
		Deathfall is a mining village operated by the Order of the Red Sun. Outside of the knights, dames, and
		some of the guards brought in, the village of Deathfall is almost entirely human. Most of the inhabitants
		are descend from the prior inhabitants of Asokmoat and have a bad tendency to form dark cults in the
		isolation of the village. For this reason, and also because the village is frequently attacked by orcs,
		the Order of the Red Sun watches Deathfall carefully.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Ang (iron) River, which flows from the Mount of Decay, is the the river that Deathfall is built
		on the southern edge of.
