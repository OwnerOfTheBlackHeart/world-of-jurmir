<h2>Organizations and Monsters</h2>
<h3>Teamsters' and Porters' Economic Alliance of Taaira Ruzara</h3>
<p>
	The Teamsters' and Porters' Economic Alliance of Taaira Ruzara is an organization made up of several guilds across
	Taaira Ruzara that cover porters and teamsters who handles collecting and distributing transportation jobs, both
	singular and recurring. The Alliance also serves to ensure that trade routes and roads are maintained and protected,
	though the guild does not offer any mercenary services to help in this task. For protection, the Alliance typically
	relies on local guards and slayers.

<h3>The Slayers' Guild</h3>
<p>

</p>

<h3>Woodcutters' Guild</h3>
<p>

</p>

<h3>Shipbuilders' Guild</h3>
<p>

</p>

<h3>Mercers' (textile merchants) Guild</h3>
<p>
	They mostly sell to the large number of travelling merchants and the dwarves of Mam Daruhm.
</p>

<h3>The Mayoral Council</h3>
<p>
	The Mayoral Council is a group in charge of electing the mayor of Keldhall every 10 years. The Council is made up of 5
	members that are elected by the merchant class that can acquire one of the 101 voter's licenses every 5 years. While the
	mayor handles day to day administrative duties and the drafting of laws, the Mayoral Council is in charge of accepting
	or denying any laws and budgets the mayor presents.
</p>
<p>
	The Mayoral Council does not choose who is running for mayor, only which of the final 2 candidates becomes mayor. When
	time for a new major rolls around, the mayor selects 3 candidates (possibly including themselves) and the town guilds
	may elect up to 7 candidates, which the 101 voters then vote on, with the 2 most popular going to the Mayoral Council
	for the final vote.
</p>
<p>
	The Mayoral Council is elected via the local guilds, with a spot reserved for a representative of the local duke.

<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h3>The Hall of Guilds</h3>
<p>
	The Hall of Guilds is a massive 3 story, waddle and daub building painted yellow and green that serves as the administrative
	hub of all the legal guilds within Keldhall. The first floor is a hall of offices for the basic representatives of the various
	guilds that can handle joining, leaving, and lodging complaints with the guild as well as a basic kitchen and eating area at the
	back of the first floor. The second floor holds 8 large rooms in which basic training, meetings and lectures can be held. The
	third floor holds the more advanced administrative offices of the guilds where guild members can go to handle being assigned
	jobs and the like.
</p>
<p>
	A basement with a shared vault handles the distribution of rewards for completed tasks. A writ of completion and the job receipt
	are required to retrieve anything from the vault. 
</p>

<h3>Town Hall</h3>
<p>
	A longhouse style log building with plenty of windows, the town hall hosts administrative offices, including the office of the
	mayor and the court of the town judge. The workers of the town hall can help with many basic functions including, but not limited
	to, registering a new guild, paying taxes, or notarizing deeds.

<h3>Template</h3>
<p>
	Oops is a stout building barely sized to fit humans made of mud with a poorly cared for white wash. Inside the building,
	similarly white washed pillars, with plenty of scaring, support the low roof. In the main room are alchemically reinforced
	glass shelves filled with ingredients and alchemically created materials, with a scorched wooden counter that Prilin
	Fockle normally works behind. In the back are three smaller rooms: A mixing room for combining ingredients, a firing
	room for burning, firing, and baking materials, and a storage room where the base ingredients are kept away from fires
	and explosions.
</p>
<p>
	Explosive, reactive, and quickly decaying materials are made upon request and are only kept in storage for 24 hours.
