	<h2>GM Notes</h2>
	<p>
		The highest leader of Antys is the Arch Mage of Antys (Baelihareth) who handles immediate problems as
		they come up. While the Arch Mage has executive power, legislative power is held by the
		Council of Knowledge and Wisdom, of which the Arch Mage serves as the chairman. The Council
		is made up of the Arch Mage, the head mage of each of the eight schools of magic (lvl 10), the high 
		priest (lvl 10) from each of the 5 elven churches, and the 4 elder druids (lvl 10).
	</p>
	<p>
		The lower levels of Antys are available to all who remain civil within Antys, however the
		upper levels are only available to elves and those who have direct elven ancestry that is
		willing to testify that they are elven (such as a parent or grandparent). Other exceptions
		may be applied for, in which case the non-elf is given a pass to be allowed to enter a
		specific section of the upper trees.

	the 5 elven gods convening, of early elven civilization, and of Durn guiding mortals that has a gold carpet 
	going down the middle and pews, desks, and tables and chairs along the sides of the room. At the end of the
	entrance is a set of large wooden doors that depict Kyranious creating Kriotz, Durn, and Sithrak that leads
	to a chapel that seats 500 and is designed so that the speaker can be easily heard from the altar.
</p>
<p>

<h3>The Hall of Agility</h3>
<p>

	into the root of the great tree. The front of the building has a set of stairs that leads to the 3rd story, where

<h3>The Hall of Knowledge</h3>
<p>
	Located on the 21st to 30 levels Within the great tree Throbrar, as a part of the Holy College of the Deciphered Mystery, 
	the Hall of Knowledge is primarily the shrine on the 21st floor, the ritual rooms on the 22nd floor, the clergies' cells
	on the 23rd and 24th floors and the support offices that run from the 25th floor to the 30th floor. 
</p>
<p>
	The shrine on the 21st floor is placed within the ampitheater at the far end of a open room in which 4 person tables, 
	wooden stalls and bookshelves are scattered about with a central "road" that forms a clear pathway to the ampitheater. 
	Outside of when the clergy of Kriotz clear the 21st floor, it is constantly buzzing with magic users discussing theory 
	and experimentation with the occasionally sermon or service happening at the ampitheater.
</p>
<p>
	The 22nd floor looks like the classrooms on the higher levels with 4 large, spacious rooms, however, rather than having
	desks or lab tables, the ritual rooms have shelves stocked with ingredients and 2 tables for other ritual preparations
	with the rest of the empty room being left open for the rituals the rooms are intended to be held in.
</p>
<p>
	The Hall of Knowledge is a temple dedicated to Kriotz, and her intelligence, that is lead by the priest brother Shelath.

<h3>The Hall of Strength</h3>
<p>
	Located underneath of the great tree Kaothi (the dragon gate), the Hall of Strength is built within a large, natural cave.
	Walking into the cave from the entrance at the base of the great tree, a long tunnel drops down into a bridge over an 
	artificial pond in which eyeless fish swim, after which the tunnel resumes upward until it reaches the main chamber. The
	main chamber is an open room large enough to seat 250 people in the pews setup with the shrine at the end of the room
	built within an ampitheater made from the skeleton of a great wyrm gold dragon. The decorations of the main chamber range
	from banners with each of the colors of chromatic and metallic dragons to pearl statues as tall as a man of each of the
	types of dragon.
</p>
<p>
	The artificial pond over which the stone bridge extends is fed by ditches on either side of the stone path to the main
	chamber, with two, large overflow cisterns carved out on either side of the artificial pond.
</p>
<p>
	The Hall of Strength is a temple dedicated to Kyranious, and her strength, that is lead by the priest brother Simtas.

		When Kali enters the Hall of Strength, he will be struck with a vision: He is walking on a dirt path in the forest hears
		a squeaky voice say "Only 4." He then sees a statue of Kyranious in which the goddess is reared up, ready to attack. The
		statue looks at him as the stone falls off and her scales show the colors of the chromatic and metallic dragons. Kali then
		smells chlorine before coming back to reality.

<h3>The Hall of Charisma</h3>
<p>
	Located on the 18th level of both the great trees Throbrar and Kaothi, the Hall of Charisma is a long, single story building
	built on the point at which a branch of the great Throbrar winds itself around a branch of the great tree Kaothi. Even by elven 
	standards the Hall of Charisma is a work of art with stories carved and painted into every square inch of the building with
	large glass artworks making up the windows of the Hall and wooden statues carved into the load bearing columns of the building.
	Despite	being only a single story tall, the Hall of Charisma has 4 distinct sections: The Library of Works, the Gallery of Works 
	Recent and Great, the practice rooms, and the Bar of Liquid Joy.
</p>
<p>
	Closest to the great tree Throbrar is the is the Gallery of Works Recent and Great, a large room where local statues, jewelry,
	paintings, written songs and poems, artistically made clothes, and more are displayed. The hard to steal pieces, such as large
	statues and paintings within locked cases, are kept at the front entrance of the Gallery. In the back, surrounded by the easily
	stolen works, is an alter to Lindo that is topped with a 3 foot tall, painted iron statue of pre-lich Lindo. The Gallery is
	"patrolled" by various clergy of Lindo who keep it clean, answer questions, and work to prevent theft.
</p>
<p>
	Attached to the Gallery of Works Recent and Great is the Bar of Liquid Joy, which is a long room with three stages, plenty of
	round tables, and a bar that runs the length of the room. The bar usually has at least 3 bartenders. Behind the bar is a door
	to the kitchen, which usually has two to four kitchen workers. The Bar of Liquid Joy is often packed with bards, locals, and
	wizards and it is a rare sight to see a meal time without all three stages in use.
</p>
<p>
	Attached to the Bar of Liquid Joy is the collection of mostly empty rooms known as the practice rooms. These rooms are open
	rooms with closets and cabinets filled with supplies ranging from paint to ink to clay with easels and ladders and stands.
	Many of the practice rooms are left with multiple, partially completed works while the artists rest and sometimes they will
	be used for classes offered by the worshippers of Lindo. When a room will be used for one, or more, classes the room will
	be marked as such.
</p>
<p>
	The final section of the Hall of Charisma, and the closest to the great tree Kaothi, is the Library of Works. The library
	is broken up into a main room and a loft, with the loft containing smaller works while the ground floor contains many large
	works. Within both the main room and the loft are works as varied as those in the Gallery, and most within the library have
	spent time within the Gallery. Randomly spread throughout the displays are eight person, square, wooden tables with matching
	chairs at which those studying, or just generally enjoying, the works within the Library may be found.
</p>
<p>
	The Hall of Charisma is a temple dedicated to Lindo, and his artistry, that is lead by the priestess sister Arispar Lyath.
