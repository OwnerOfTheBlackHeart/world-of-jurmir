<h3>Jack's Pub</h3>
<p>
	A large, single room pub built next to a warehouse, Jack's pub is run by Black Eye Jack. The pub
	has two fireplaces, one on the north side and one on the south side, that keep the building warm.
	The bar runs across half of the east wall, with a door to the kitchen behind it. To the south of
	the bar is 3 doors that lead to private planning rooms. The rest of the main room is tables and
	chairs.
</p>
<p>
	Jack's Pub is only open from sunset to sunrise and is worked by Jack and whichever kitchen worker
	he decides to call upon for the day. Jack's Pub doesn't have rooms for rent.
</p>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm baytide-full noble-full jacks-pub-clientele">
	<p>
		Jack's Pub serves boaters and pirates alike, as well as many questionable people.
	</p>
</ap-auth-container>

<h3>The Temple of the Unfinished God</h3>
<p>
	The Temple of the Unfinished God is made of dwarven stone with masterfully made mosaic glass. The main
	room of the temple is big enough to handle 100 people in the pews with excellent acoustics. Behind the
	stage stands a 20 foot tall mithral and copper statue of Zigies. On the side walls are doors to the 
	monasteries that house the monks and nuns that maintain the temple and work the forges behind the temple.
</p>
<p>
	The current priest of Zigies is Brother Bromnar Forgeborn.
</p>

<h3>The Wolf Riders Mail Service</h3>
<p>
	The Wolf Riders Mail Service is a relatively simple wattle and daub building with two stories and a
	surprisingly large set of stables behind the building. The main room consists of a desk which handles
	setting up and retrieving deliveries as well as handing mail off to the couriers. Behind it is several
	locked cabinets filled with mail ready for pickup and an entrance to the mail vault in the basement.
	The publicly accessible upper story is a temple to Feph with a 2 foot tall, painted wooden monument to him.
</p>
<p>
	The current priest of Feph is Brother Fissuss Jumping Fire.
</p>

<h3>Driftwood Shipsmith</h3>
<p>
	Driftwood Shipsmith takes up the north most stone dock in Baytide and is actually a dry dock with a
	storefront and 2 warehouses. The storefront is small, wood plank shack with shelves that have miniature
	river boat models on them as well as a single desk behind which Shoz Boatswain sits when she isn't busy
	fixing or building ships.
</p>

<h3>The Docks</h3>
<p>
	The docks form the western side of Baytide and are primarily wooden docks made for smaller
	river boats, however there are 4 cut stone docks that can handle keelboats. About 50 feet from the
	docks themselves are a mix of shops and warehouses that are available for rent. Most warehouses
	offer at least 10 rooms worth of sleeping quarters.
</p>

<h3>Dying Tiger Manner</h3>
<p>
	This fortified mansion stands at the edge of Baytide, and is clearly a newer construction.
	The outer wall is made of a thick, steel fence that seems unaffected by the elements with an
	inner wall made of dwarven cut stone, which houses most of the actual defenses. The mansion
	itself is made from 18 trees that have been cut into posts with plastered and painted wood
	planks forming the red and yellow walls of the mansion.
</p>
<p>
	The inside of the mansion is made primarily with wood planks with carpeting on the floors.
	The front door leads to a mud room which connects to a easy to clean meeting room and a
	heavily decorated sitting room with only enough seating for 6 people. The only other notable
	room of the mansion is the heavily guarded armory, which few people outside of the Order of the
	Red Sun get to see.
</p>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm baytide-full noble-full dying-tiger-manner-armory">
	<p>
		The armory is built into the basement of the manner and is locked via a vault door. Within
		the armory are 6 magic weapons, only 1 of which Merhiss owns. His magic weapon is a +2
		burning spear named Ragethorn.
	</p>
</ap-auth-container>
<p>
	Behind the manner is a courtyard which houses a wildflower garden and servants' quarters.
</p>
<p>
	Between the inner and outer walls is several public training areas with practice weapons, targets
	and dummies that are maintained by Lily-Mae Williamson with funds set asside by Merhiss.
