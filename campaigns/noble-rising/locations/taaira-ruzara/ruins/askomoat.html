<p>
	The Keepers of the Black City is a collection of Lindites that have taken to maintaining the Black City of Askomoat.
	They do their best to keep the undead calm and to try to get the spirits of the past to move on, and to remove of any incorporeal undead within the
	city walls.
</p>
<p>
	Throughout the Black City of Askomoat, the Keepers of the Black City have set up shrines and outposts, with most being headed by a Crypttender, who 
	is in charge of maintaining the protective shrine and performing protective rituals to all lesser keepers to travel about Askomoat without issue.

<h3 id="the-gates">The Gates</h3>
<p>
	A pair of plastered brick towers on either side of a brown and dull green stone portcullis, the Gates is the only remaining entrance into Askomoat.
	Within the Gates is a small "village" containing 34 permanent residents in plastered dirt homes, with the shrine that protects the Gates being placed
	at the center in a structurally stable, but well worn, stone house that is missing its second floor.

</p>

<h3 id="the-hall-of-the-seven-gods">The Hall of the Seven Gods</h3>
<p>
	A massive square stone church believed to be from the time before the human gods, the signs of ancient dwarven craftsmanship are abundant with perfect arches,
	rectangular doorways and expertly crafted mosaics of each of the seven gods present. The shrines present are of, in order from left to right,
	<ap-link-button linkName="sithrak">Sithrak</ap-link-button>, <ap-link-button linkName="zigies">Zigies</ap-link-button>, 
	<ap-link-button linkName="durn">Durn</ap-link-button>, <ap-link-button linkName="kyranious">Kyranious</ap-link-button>,

	<ap-link-button linkName="lindo">Lindo</ap-link-button> (which shows no signs of his status as the god of death), with the shrines nearer the center being more 
	prominent. The main temple is well kept, with fine pews	filling the nave and a black carpet. In the basement lies 2 rooms with 8 bunks each that house the permanent 
	personnel of the Hall.

	A mud brick crypt with a wooden door stands at the center of 17 carriage sized tents with a simple shrine to <ap-link-button linkName="lindo">Lindo</ap-link-button>
	placed in the entry way of the crypt. Above the door lies the word "Fick" in a, now unused, cursive style alphabet. The Fick Crypt itself sits in the center of the
	largest graveyard within Askomoat.

</p>

<h3 id="pooles-house">Poole's House</h3>
<p>
	A relatively modern construction within Askomoat, Poole's House is a wattle and daub mansion within a wall made of 7 foot tall wooden planks interspersed with
	occasional sections of 2 inch think, 45 foot long walls of stone with crude crenellations. The mansion itself is 3 stories tall with small farms growing where
	gardens would be placed on a typical mansion's lawn. The inside of the house is well furnished, with carpets, rugs, paintings and busts, all of Lindo or of scenes
	important to the worshipers of Lindo, though a constant gloom fills the air. At the back of the ball room of the mansion lies the well cared for alter of Lindo,
	made from finely carved bone.
</p>
<p>
	The quarters of Poole's House houses 41 permanent occupants, 10 of which are house servants (a male pantherfolk, female leopardfold, 2 female gnomes, a female half elf,
	4 female tieflings and a male tiefling).

<h3 id="greenflame-crater">The Greenflame Crater</h3>
<p>
	Surrounding a fenced off crater, a ring of partially restored homes house the clergy maintaining the alter at the center of the Greenflame Crater. The houses
	are mostly made of mud brick, though sections have clearly been re-plastered and/or repaired with wood or round stone, and house the 11 residents of the crater.
	The crater itself is 57 feet in diameter with a set of steep stairs leading to a bone alter at the center, above which floats a ball of unsettling green flame,
	which is nearly 12 feet in diameter.
</p>
<p>
	Rumors have it that the Greenflame Crater is the physical location where the infertility curse was placed on humanity, though the nature of the Greenflame itself
	is poorly understood.

<h3 id="4-kings-crypt">4 Kings' Crypt</h3>
<p>
	Placed at the ruins of the original castle of Askomoat, the 4 Kings' Crypt is the remains of an old tradition of burying the last 4 kings within a temporary crypt
	until another king dies and the oldest of the buried kings is taken to their family crypt. The current residents of the white and black crypt are unknown to modern
	scholars, though their corpses remain proudly on display and maintained by the clerics of Lindo. The clerics live in the few structurally sound rooms of the round
	stone castle, hosting 13 to 27 permanent residents, depending on the number of rooms being actively kept up. The shrine lies in the center of the decayed main hall
	of the castle, completely exposed to the elements, yet unharmed.

<h3 id="king-lenges-crypt">King Lange's Crypt</h3>
<p>
	Unlike the many shallow crypts within and around Askomoat, King Lange's Crypt is a small, plastered, mud brick building that leads to an underground complex dedicated
	to keeping the corpse of King Lange trapped within and undisturbed. The gate to King Lange's Crypt is an almost new steel bar door, locked by an enchanted amazing/superior
	lock (DC 50). Surrounding King Lange's Crypt is a massive graveyard from the time of King Lange's defeat, which itself is placed around a pile of stone rubble in the
	vague shape of an ancient castle.
