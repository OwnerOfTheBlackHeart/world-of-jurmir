<h1>The Eight Great Towers</h1>
<p>
	A ring of eight mages' towers in various states of repair and made from a strange mix of materials, the Eight Great Towers
	is equal parts ruin, monument, and active mages' towers, with the remaining 3 mages still competing to see who can build
	the tallest tower in their lifetime. The towers range from 270 feet tall to nearly 500 feet tall. Records indicate that
	the competition started a little under 200 years ago.
</p>
<p>
	Many of the materials used in the construction of the Eight Great Towers are rumored to be magically created, alchemically
	augmented and any mix of the two.
</p>

<h2 id="important-people">Important People</h2>
<p>
	The wizards are listed in clockwise order starting at the northmost tower.
</p>

<h3 id="zitt">Zitt</h3>
<p>
	Zitt is a 2' 8", male kobold with dull red scales interspersed with shining brass scales and cataracted red eyes.
	Zitt normally wears a set of dark blue, almost purple mages robes and carries a simple staff that he uses as a walking
	stick. 
</p>
<p>
	Zitt's tower ascends roughly 47 stories and is made of a combination of materials, from standard stone at the bottom
	to enchanted wood and alchemical bricks at the upper floors.
</p>

<h3 id="nadge">Nadge The Defiant</h3>
<p>
	An orc mage who has fallen over the past 200 years, Nadge the Defiant's tower is as much of an expression of her
	defiance as her title. The tower, standing roughly 31 stories, with evidence of at least 3 more stories, is held up by 4
	adamantine pillars, with the alchemically sealed wooden walls and floors attached to the pillars with mithral ties.
</p>
<p>
	Nadge was an orc, and was buried at the base of her tower.
</p>

<h3 id="dastra-flowerkind">Dastra Flowerkind</h3>
<p>
	Dastra is a 5' 5", female elf with B cup titties, long light red hair that flows like pedals in the wind, nearly ashen skin,
	silver eyes, and a surprisingly healthy build for her age. Dastra normally wears a well fitted pair of wools shorts with a
	matching vest and a fleece lined, silk cloak with an almost mural-like pattern of the banks of the Ang River.
</p>
<p>
	Dastra's tower stands 45 stories tall and is grown from a single darkwood tree.
</p>

<h3 id="therrass">Therrass Falling Sky</h3>
<p>
	A catfolk mage who was the first of the Eight Great Mages to die, Therrass's tower only stands 27 stories tall, with a hint of
	2 stories lost. His tower is made of shaped stone, magically warped wood and packed mud, all of which show no gaps excepting
	the many holes in the walls where the passing of time has forced the tower open.
</p>

<h3 id="menisshar">Menisshar Rising Tail</h3>
<p>
	A catfolk mage who died after falling out of his tower, Menisshar's tower ascends 35 stories into the sky and appears unravaged
	by the passing of time, the only damage to it being that of prior attempts to break into the tower. The tower itself seems to
	be made of cob with scaffolding made of iron and braided twigs surrounding the whole tower.
</p>

<h3 id="erik-khan">Erik Khan</h3>
<p>
	A tiefling mage that is considered by his peers to be the most eccentric of the Eight Great Mages, Erik's tower stands 43 stories,
	though holes in the walls have multiple rooms within the tower. The tower itself is made of beautiful, perfect white marble over 
	granite	with a strange, textured <ap-auth-container permissions="gm noble-full erik-khan-carbon-fiber" inline>(carbon fiber)</ap-auth-container>
	black pillar running up the center of the tower.
</p>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm noble-full erik-khan-stones">
	<p>
		The stones used in Erik's tower were taken from the Plane of Earth.

<h3 id="keythana-birder">Keythana Birder</h3>
<p>
	Keythana is a 5' 1", female elf with A cup titties, long, braided brown hair that she wraps around her waist like a belt, the tanned skin
	of a wild elf, blue eyes and an average build. Keythana wears the layered robes and pants of a traveling scholar without any dyes, though
	she is heavily decorated in platinum jewelry.
</p>
<p>
	Keythana's tower stands 48 stories tall, making it the current winner of the competition. Her tower is made up of several rectangular pyramids
	with steep slopes, each one built over the last, going from stone to mithral to wood to darkwood, making her tower the widest of the
	Eight Great Towers.
</p>

<h3 id="zukarriss">Zukarriss Rustling Grass</h3>
<p>
	The longest lived of the catfolk among the Eight Great Mages, Zukarriss's tower stands 33 stories with evidence of at least 4 stories having
	collapsed. Zukarriss's tower is actually two towers made primarily of dried brick with steel struts connecting them every five stories, though
	2 of the struts have fallen off and the remainder are heavily rusted.
