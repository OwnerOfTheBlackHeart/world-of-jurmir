<h2>Organizations and Monsters</h2>
<h3>The Slayers' Guild</h3>
<p>
	The Slayers' Guild is an organization responsible for managing a social caste known as "slayers" who are hired to
	kill monsters, criminals, and enemies of the state or retrieve objects from monsters and/or dungeons. The Slayers'
	Guild is the largest source of jobs for slayers in Desserr, but has been suffering from a reduction of slayers as
	of late. It uses the same ranking system as the Slayers' Guild of Mensharra.
</p>

<h3>Teamsters' and Porters' Economic Alliance of Taaira Ruzara</h3>
<p>
	The Teamsters' and Porters' Economic Alliance of Taaira Ruzara is an organization made up of several guilds across
	Taaira Ruzara that cover porters and teamsters who handles collecting and distributing transportation jobs, both
	singular and recurring. The Alliance also serves to ensure that trade routes and roads are maintained and protected,
	though the guild does not offer any mercenary services to help in this task. For protection, the Alliance typically
	relies on local guards and slayers.
</p>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm desserr-full noble-full tpea-member-relations">
	<p>
		The Teamsters' and Porters' Economic Alliance of Taaira Ruzara is actually interested in protecting its members.
	</p>
</ap-auth-container>

<h3>Order of the Red Sun</h3>
<p>
	The Order of the Red Sun is an equestrian order within the county of Taaira Ruzara. The Order of the Red Sun requires
	that each member be approved by the current count of Taaira Ruzara and is proud of the difficulty of entry. Due to
	its association with the count, many of the members of the Order of the Red Sun serve, permanently or temporarily, as
	part of the count's royal guard. The typical member of the Order of the Red Sun oversees heavily civilized lands and
	works to maintain a few fighting men.
</p>
<p>
	The symbol of the Order of the Red Sun is a red circle with lines placed around it to represent the rays of the sun.
	The order tries to associate itself with tradition and with civilization.
</p>
<p>
	The main rival to the Order of the Red Sun is the Order of the Full Moon, which the Red Sun tolerates, with most
	members considering the members of the Order of the Full Moon to be uncivilized, wild men.
</p>

<h3>Order of the Full Moon</h3>
<p>
	The Order of the Full Moon is an equestrian order within the county of Taaira Ruzara. The typical member of the
	Order of the Full Moon is given domain over less populated areas of the county, typically in charge of ensuring
	that the wilder lands remain under control of the lord/lady, under which the knight/dame serves. Unlike the Order
	of the Red Sun, the Order of the Full Moon doesn't require the count's permission to induct a new member.
</p>
<p>
	The symbol of the Order of the Full Moon is a whitish blue full moon with a gray wolf howling at it. The Order has
	a wild motif to it.
</p>
<p>
	The Order of the Full Moon technically gets along with the Order of the Red Sun, but this is often more of tolerating
	the more traditional order. There is a level of rivalry between the two orders.

	of two towers on the southern face and a main building with a northern and southern courtyard. The main building
	houses the living areas, the dungeons, the court itself, and storage. In the northern courtyard has a small brick
	building that serves as the kitchen and a main garden that can be looked over by a balcony on the main building.
	The southern courtyard has several benches, the gatehouse, the entrance to the main building, and plenty of tree
	cover.
</p>
<p>
	In the court is a room that holds a crystal ball. This crystal ball can normally only see within the court room.
</p>
<p>
	A level 5, or higher, wizard can use the crystal ball fully.
</p>

<h3>Slayer's Guild HQ</h3>
<p>
	This sun-baked brick building, resembling a church, is roughly 3 stories tall and is made up of a main hall and 
	and a small suite of offices off to the left of the main hall. In the main hall is a small dining area, several
	empty planning tables, and boards of various grades upon which jobs are posted. The offices, which are accessed
	via a door next to the bar, is where jobs are turned in at as well as where new jobs are taken to be posted.
</p>

<h3>Arthur's Swordworks</h3>
<p>
	Owned by the human smith Arthur, this large mud brick building is about the size of a great hall and is filled with
	swords of all sizes and shapes: Curved, straight, single and double edged, short, long and great, and even more.
</p>

<h3>Eye of Newt</h3>
<p>
	A simple white mud building that offers a weaved twig front door. Entering the shop reveals a gnome (no one has seen 
	the same gnome twice) sitting in a soft chair with a table and second chair for customers. The shelves are made of
	magically carved stone that has been enchanted so that only the currently working gnome can remove objects from them.
</p>
<p>
	Blue scrolls (they have a random spell on them that is determined when they open) can be bought for 300gp (minor),
	600gp (medium), or 1,500gp (major).
</p>

<h3>No, We're Not A Petting Zoo</h3>
<p>
	No, We're Not A Petting Zoo is made up of two parts: The first is a barn containing 10 stables that can handle 2
	horses each with a fenced off yard big enough to hold 6 wagons. The second is a large, warehouse like building with
	several animal stalls, a shop, and a second yard with several ready wooden vehicles, half elven works of art and half
	human made. The store buys and sells animals, with a few work and riding horses available at all times. It also sells
	animal feed, land vehicles, wheels, barding, and more animal related goods. Leomaer, the owner, can also be payed to
	purchase, and provide short term care, for animals he doesn't have in stock.
</p>
<p>
	No, We're Not A Petting Zoo was previously named Horses N' More, but after too many people treated the store's stock
	as a petting zoo, he changed the name of the shop out of frustration.
</p>

<h3>Desserr Tailoring</h3>
<p>
	Desserr Tailoring is a long building that has been grown out of 4 trees using elven magics. The building itself could
	be considered a work of art with a big, mahogany arch around an artistically carved door of the same wood, carved
	murals on all the walls, and near perfect glass windows. Inside the building is a show room with clothes, ranging from
	leather farm clothes to extravagant silks, and a beautiful redwood counter. The clothes are grouped into "human quality" 
	and "elven quality". There is also two changing rooms and a back room for fitting and making clothes. A shelf towards the
	back of the showroom has different fabrics that can be purchased in spools.
</p>
<p>
	Desserr Tailoring is owned by Reyrona Dathana and also worked by Emmie Burton.
</p>

<h3>Pretty Gold Things</h3>
<p>
	A smaller building made of cut stone, Pretty Gold Things is clearly dwarven. From the precise cut of the stone to the
	masterfully worked iron sign, the work of a dwarf is obvious. Inside the shop is a stone counter with steel and glass
	displays filled with gems, rings, necklaces and other forms of jewelry, all which can only be opened from behind the
	counter. Pretty Gold Things is owned by Urmmir Ungert.
</p>

<h3>Oops</h3>

	similarly white washed pillars, with plenty of scaring, support the low roof. In the main room are alchemically reinforced
	glass shelves filled with ingredients and alchemically created materials, with a scorched wooden counter that Prilin
	Fockle normally works behind. In the back are three smaller rooms: A mixing room for combining ingredients, a firing
	room for burning, firing, and baking materials, and a storage room where the base ingredients are kept away from fires
	and explosions.
</p>
<p>
	Explosive, reactive, and quickly decaying materials are made upon request and are only kept in storage for 24 hours.
</p>

<h3>Hawk and Fang Goods</h3>
<p>
	Hawk and Fang Goods is a general and adventuring goods store which sells mundane, trade, and basic alchemical goods.
	It is owned by Nasshurr Diving Hawk, but the front is normally staffed by Fang, who happily greets anyone who walks
	in the door.
</p>
<p>
	While Hawk and Fang Goods appears as a small shop from the front, it is actually closer to an emporium with a large
	main room that Fang can easily watch over from the elevated counter that houses the vast majority of the goods. At
	the back of the main room is a door which leads to the smithy where Nasshurr is typically working and where most of
	the armor and weapons are located.
</p>

<h3>Horse Shoe Tavern</h3>
<p>
	The Horse Shoe Tavern is a single story building made of wattle and daub with a round stone main fireplace (viewable
	from outside the building) and a depressed, sun dried brick building in the back. The wattle and daub section holds
	the tavern, filled with tables, a comfortable fireplace and a bar opposite the entry door. The brick section holds
	the kitchen with a cooking fire pit and spit as well as food storage and plenty of food prep tables. The sign is of 
	a horseshoe with a mug within the horseshoe.
</p>
<p>
	Behind the tavern is a group of 6 outhouses, a courtyard, and the Horse Shoe Motel. The motel is 2 stories tall with
	10 rooms a floor. Each room has a single bed, a kitchenette centered around an oven that doubles as a heater, an 
	area for a chamber pot, a door with a good lock, a comfortable sitting chair and a table and chair setup like a desk.
</p>

<h3>Alliance Hall</h3>
<p>
	The main building for the administration of the Teamsters' and Porters' Economic Alliance of Taaira Ruzara in Desserr,
	the Alliance Hall is a beautiful log great hall with a surrounding wooden plank building. The great hall contains a
	kitchen, bar, and resting area where members of the Alliance can relax, exchange trading information, make deals, and
	pick up orders. Two doors, one on each side of the great hall, lead into the plank wood building that wraps around 
	the hall, which contains the offices for the Alliance.
</p>
<p>
	Lyla Hunter works as the secretary for the Alliance Hall.
</p>

<h3>The College of the Tuned Ear</h3>
<p>
	A church of Lindo and bardic college. The building itself is a wattle and daub, 3 story building, with a stone first
	floor. The building itself lacks the gaudy style typical of Lindo, but within the building is a gallery of past projects
	completed by the clergy and the students (floor 1), a library of legends and lore (floor 2), and classrooms (floor 3).
</p>
<p>
	A second building behind the college serves as the kitchen, dining hall, and living quarters. It is a basic round
	stone building in the shape of a long house.
</p>

<h3>The Queen Venvyre Memorial Library</h3>
<p>
	The Queen Venvyre Memorial Library is a library built in the name of the previous queen. The outside of the building
	is made from marble, with massive pillars 4 stories tall making up the 4 corners of the main building, with several
	smaller additions, all made in part from the marble that they removed, breaking up the rectangular shape of the
	building. The front of the library has a massive, stained glass mural of Queen Venvyre slaying the Minotaur King.
</p>
<p>
	Inside the library, all of the floors and bookshelves are made of living wood, with the main trunk rising out of
	the library building to form a canopy above it. Within the library are 3 stories, with the first story being two
	stories tall. Each of the stories is visible from the front desk, which sits next to the multiple entrance doors.
</p>
<p>
	The Queen Venvyre Memorial Library is operated by the government of Desserr and acquires books both by purchasing
	them and by having them donated by wealthy, or scholarly, individuals.
</p>
<p>
	A building built onto the back of the library is a church-college of Kriotz, offering training in wizardry with all
	well known spells of 3rd level, or lower, available for a standard fee (or provided as part of an apprenticeship).
</p>

<h3>The Fighting Fletcher</h3>
<p>
	A shop made of thin wood planks with a long back room that gives the building a T shape. The inside of the shop is
	a small room with stands containing arrows and fletching supplies with the walls holding bows on hooks and a counter
	made of the same thin plank wood that makes up the building itself. In the back of the building is an archery range,
	complete with scarecrow and bullseye targets, available for both use and purchase.
</p>
<p>
	The Fighting Fletcher is owned by Petris Amash, but is usually worked by his daughter Thessana Amash.
</p>

<h3>Misty's</h3>
<p>
	The building is an abandoned looking warehouse with a constant dim glow emanating from it. Within the warehouse is a
	"front desk," a bar, a small dinning area, and 12 private rooms (which are located on a second floor). In the dinning
	area is a stage that always seems to have some musical act. The furniture on the lower floor is all made of good wood
	and painted with gaudy drawings.
</p>
<p>
	The rooms upstairs each contain a chamber pot, small iron heater, queen sized bed, and a small, clean fountain. They
	are fairly nice.
</p>
<p>
	Most of the whores work in the dining area, giving dances and shows to those with the coin who flag them down. However,
	there are "whores," more like slaves, that can be rented/purchased from the basement. It is common to find fences and
	drug dealers hanging out in the dining area as well, and some might even find street toughs willing to work without
	question, so long as they get paid.
</p>
<p>
	Currently run by a male halfling who smokes the calming kush.
</p>
