<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h3>Count Zesharr Black's Castle</h3>
<p>
	In the center of town, on a raised hill is the castle, which is made of round stone. The castle itself is made up
	of two towers on the southern face and a main building with a northern and southern courtyard. The main building
	houses the living areas, the dungeons, the court itself, and storage. In the northern courtyard has a small brick
	building that serves as the kitchen and a main garden that can be looked over by a balcony on the main building.
	The southern courtyard has several benches, the gatehouse, the entrance to the main building, and plenty of tree
	cover.
</p>

<h3>Slayer's Guild HQ</h3>
<p>
	This sun-baked brick building, resembling a church, is roughly 3 stories tall and is made up of a main hall and 
	and a small suite of offices off to the left of the main hall. In the main hall is a small dining area, several
	empty planning tables, and boards of various grades upon which jobs are posted. The offices, which are accessed
	via a door next to the bar, is where jobs are turned in at as well as where new jobs are taken to be posted.
</p>

<h3>Arthur's Swordworks</h3>
<p>
	Owned by the human smith Arthur, this large mud brick building is about the size of a great hall and is filled with
	swords of all sizes and shapes: Curved, straight, single and double edged, short, long and great, and even more.
</p>

<h3>Eye of Newt</h3>
<p>
	A simple white mud building that offers a weaved twig front door. Entering the shop reveals a gnome (no one has seen 
	the same gnome twice) sitting in a soft chair with a table and second chair for customers. The shelves are made of
	magically carved stone that has been enchanted so that only the currently working gnome can remove objects from them.
</p>

<h3>No, We're Not A Petting Zoo</h3>
<p>
	No, We're Not A Petting Zoo is made up of two parts: The first is a barn containing 10 stables that can handle 2
	horses each with a fenced off yard big enough to hold 6 wagons. The second is a large, warehouse like building with
	several animal stalls, a shop, and a second yard with several ready wooden vehicles, half elven works of art and half
	human made. The store buys and sells animals, with a few work and riding horses available at all times. It also sells
	animal feed, land vehicles, wheels, barding, and more animal related goods. Leomaer, the owner, can also be payed to
	purchase, and provide short term care, for animals he doesn't have in stock.
</p>
<p>
	No, We're Not A Petting Zoo was previously named Horses N' More, but after too many people treated the store's stock
	as a petting zoo, he changed the name of the shop out of frustration.
</p>

<h3>Desserr Tailoring</h3>
<p>
	Desserr Tailoring is a long building that has been grown out of 4 trees using elven magics. The building itself could
	be considered a work of art with a big, mahogany arch around an artistically carved door of the same wood, carved
	murals on all the walls, and near perfect glass windows. Inside the building is a show room with clothes, ranging from
	leather farm clothes to extravagant silks, and a beautiful redwood counter. The clothes are grouped into "human quality" 
	and "elven quality". There is also two changing rooms and a back room for fitting and making clothes. A shelf towards the
	back of the showroom has different fabrics that can be purchased in spools.
</p>
<p>
	Desserr Tailoring is owned by Reyrona Dathana and also worked by Emmie Burton.
</p>

<h3>Pretty Gold Things</h3>
<p>
	A smaller building made of cut stone, Pretty Gold Things is clearly dwarven. From the precise cut of the stone to the
	masterfully worked iron sign, the work of a dwarf is obvious. Inside the shop is a stone counter with steel and glass
	displays filled with gems, rings, necklaces and other forms of jewelry, all which can only be opened from behind the
	counter. Pretty Gold Things is owned by Urmmir Ungert.
</p>

<h3>Oops</h3>
<p>
	Oops is a stout building barely sized to fit humans made of mud with a poorly cared for white wash. Inside the building,
	similarly white washed pillars, with plenty of scaring, support the low roof. In the main room are alchemically reinforced
	glass shelves filled with ingredients and alchemically created materials, with a scorched wooden counter that Prilin
	Fockle normally works behind. In the back are three smaller rooms: A mixing room for combining ingredients, a firing
	room for burning, firing, and baking materials, and a storage room where the base ingredients are kept away from fires
	and explosions.
</p>
<p>
	Explosive, reactive, and quickly decaying materials are made upon request and are only kept in storage for 24 hours.
</p>

<h3>Hawk and Fang Goods</h3>
<p>
	Hawk and Fang Goods is a general and adventuring goods store which sells mundane, trade, and basic alchemical goods.
	It is owned by Nasshurr Diving Hawk, but the front is normally staffed by Fang, who happily greets anyone who walks
	in the door.
</p>
<p>
	While Hawk and Fang Goods appears as a small shop from the front, it is actually closer to an emporium with a large
	main room that Fang can easily watch over from the elevated counter that houses the vast majority of the goods. At
	the back of the main room is a door which leads to the smithy where Nasshurr is typically working and where most of
	the armor and weapons are located.
</p>

<h3>Horse Shoe Tavern</h3>
<p>
	The Horse Shoe Tavern is a single story building made of wattle and daub with a round stone main fireplace (viewable
	from outside the building) and a depressed, sun dried brick building in the back. The wattle and daub section holds
	the tavern, filled with tables, a comfortable fireplace and a bar opposite the entry door. The brick section holds
	the kitchen with a cooking fire pit and spit as well as food storage and plenty of food prep tables. The sign is of 
	a horseshoe with a mug within the horseshoe.
</p>
<p>
	Behind the tavern is a group of 6 outhouses, a courtyard, and the Horse Shoe Motel. The motel is 2 stories tall with
	10 rooms a floor. Each room has a single bed, a kitchenette centered around an oven that doubles as a heater, an 
	area for a chamber pot, a door with a good lock, a comfortable sitting chair and a table and chair setup like a desk.
</p>

<h3>Alliance Hall</h3>
<p>
	The main building for the administration of the Teamsters' and Porters' Economic Alliance of Taaria Ruzara in Desserr,
	the Alliance Hall is a beautiful log great hall with a surrounding wooden plank building. The great hall contains a
	kitchen, bar, and resting area where members of the Allaince can relax, exchange trading information, make deals, and
	pick up orders. Two doors, one on each side of the great hall, lead into the plank wood building that wraps around 
	the hall, which contains the offices for the Alliance.
</p>
<p>
	Lyla Hunter works as the secretary for the Allaince Hall.
</p>
