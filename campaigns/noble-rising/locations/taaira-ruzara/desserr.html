<h2>Organizations and Monsters</h2>
<h3>The Slayers' Guild</h3>
<p>
	The Slayers' Guild is an organization responsible for managing a social caste known as "slayers" who are hired to
	kill monsters, criminals, and enemies of the state or retrieve objects from monsters and/or dungeons. The Slayers'
	Guild is the largest source of jobs for slayers in Desserr, but has been suffering from a reduction of slayers as
	of late. It uses the same ranking system as the Slayers' Guild of Mensharra.
</p>

<h2>Notable Peoples</h2>
<h3>Count Zesharr Black</h3>
<p>
	Zesharr is an old catfolk with black fur that is white around his face, hands, and feet. He stands at 5' 5" and
	weighs 141 pounds. He keeps his hair shorter and styles it into spikes using specially prepared animal fat and
	he often smells of a mix of said animal fat and the sweet perfumes he prefers.
</p>
<p>
	Zesharr has a friendly disposition and generally likes to help those around him. Zesharr is the uncle of Count 
	Nesserr Black of Mensharra.
</p>
<h3>Nasshurr Diving Hawk</h3>
<p>
	Nasshurr is a tall (6' 1") and muscular catfolk who looks similar to a panther. He keeps his hair shoulder length
	in a braided ponytail and his fur shiny. He typically wears brown bear furs when he isn't wearing a cheap set of
	canvas work clothes with a leather apron.
</p>
<p>
	Nasshurr is not the friendliest catfolk on the planet and prefers to be left alone while he works at the forge... 
	unless business is involved. Nasshurr always has time for business.
</p>

<h3><ap-link-button linkName="noble-fang-img">Fang</ap-link-button></h3>
<p>
	Fang is a medium sized dog with a thick golden coat and soft, pointed ears. Unlike his master, Nasshurr, Fang loves
	people and is more than happy to talk, gossip, and receive all the pets he is allowed in a day. Fang does not wear 
	clothes, but he does have an enchanted collar with a green gem in it that allows Fang to speak and use 2 spectral
	hands.
</p>
<h3>Rish</h3>
<p>
	Angry irish halfing. About 2' 6" with crazy red hair and emerald green eyes with perfect teeth and many wrinkles on
	his forehead. Has a gay, lizardfolk butt buddy with slate scales and a patterning of white that makes him look like 
	a snowy cliff.
</p>
<h3>Thunderhammer</h3>
<p>
	Dwarf. Likes to drink, but is well cultured. Thinks highly of himself. Is interested in Sariel.
</p>

<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h3>Count Zesharr Black's Castle</h3>
<p>
	In the center of town, on a raised hill is the castle, which is made of round stone. The castle itself is made up
	of two towers on the southern face and a main building with a northern and southern courtyard. The main building
	houses the living areas, the dungeons, the court itself, and storage. In the northern courtyard is a small brick
	building that serves as the kitchen and a main garden that can be looked over by a balcony on the main building.
	The southern courtyard has several benches, the gatehouse, the entrance to the main building, and plenty of tree
	cover.
</p>
<h3>Slayer's Guild HQ</h3>
<p>
	This sun-baked brick building, resembling a church, is roughly 3 stories tall and is made up of a main hall and 
	and a small suite of offices off to the left of the main hall. In the main hall is a small dining area, several
	empty planning tables, and boards of various grades upon which jobs are posted. The offices, which are accessed
	via a door next to the bar, is where jobs are turned in at as well as where new jobs are taken to be posted.
</p>
<h3>Arthur's Swordworks</h3>
<p>
	Owned by the human smith Arthur, this large mud brick building is about the size of a great hall and is filled with
	swords of all sizes and shapes: Curved, straight, single and double edged, short, long and great, and even more.
</p>
<h3>Eye of Newt</h3>
<p>
	A simple white mud building that offers a weaved twig front door. Entering the shop reveals a gnome (no one has seen 
	the same gnome twice) sitting in a soft chair with a table and second chair for customers. The shelves are made of
	magically carved stone that has been enchanted so that only the currently working gnome can remove objects from them.
</p>
<h3>No, We're Not A Petting Zoo</h3>
<p>
	Previously Horses N' More, animal and vehicle shop
</p>
<h3>Mensharra Tailoring</h3>
<p>
	Clothing shop
</p>
<h3>Pretty Gold Things</h3>
<p>
	Jewelry shop
</p>
<h3>Oops</h3>
<p>
	Alchemy shop
</p>
<h3>Hawk and Fang Goods</h3>
<p>
	Hawk and Fang Goods is a general and adventuring goods store which sells mundane, trade, and basic alchemical goods.
	It is owned by Nasshurr Diving Hawk, but the front is normally staffed by Fang, who happily greets anyone who walks
	in the door.
</p>
<p>
	While Hawk and Fang Goods appears as a small shop from the front, it is actually closer to an emporium with a large
	main room that Fang can easily watch over from the elevated counter that houses the vast majority of the goods. At
	the back of the main room is a door which leads to the smithy where Nasshurr is typically working and where most of
	the armor and weapons are located.
</p>
<h3>Horse Shoe Tavern</h3>
<p>
	The sign is of a horseshoe with a mug within the horseshoe. Has a small motel behind the tavern.
