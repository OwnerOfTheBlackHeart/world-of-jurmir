<h2 id="notable-locations">Notable Locations</h2>
<h3 id="temple-of-the-first-lich">Temple of the First Lich</h3>
<p>
    The Temple of the First Lich is a massive temple that appears to have been made from some form of great tree that has fossilized, or otherwise been turned to
    stone. At the ground floor is the sanctuary, filled with engraved wooden pews and a raised stage with a simple alter styled like a coffin, with a small graveyard
    behind the temple. On the second floor is a series of storage and worship rooms, along with a few classrooms in which the clergy teach reading, writing and singing.
    The third floor is where the temple's treasury and the clergy's bedrooms are located. The temple appears, from the outside, to raise up at least 5 more stories,
    but they have not been carved out.
</p>
<p>
    The actual temple of the Temple of the First Lich is not to be used for bardic functions, as they could disturb the "resting." Instead, bardic functions of the
    Temple of the First Lich are done at a second temple several streets down from the main temple.
</p>
<p>
    The secondary temple is a 2 story building made of lime plastered cob, heavily featuring curved exterior walls with bright paintings, and a thatched roof. The first 
    floor holds a gallery in which local art pieces are placed on public display, with the second story consisting of a small library and 4 large rooms that are used 
    either as classrooms or as quiet places to practice.
</p>
<p>
    Next to the secondary temple is an ampitheater made of plastered sandstone bricks, which is used for plays and major musical performances. Behind the secondary
    temple rests a single story, wattle and daub building that houses the typical lindite bar and the sleeping quarters for the clergy and students of the secondary
    temple.
