<h2 id="notable-locations">Notable Locations</h2>
<h3 id="temple-of-the-first-lich">Temple of the First Lich</h3>
<p>
    The Temple of the First Lich is a massive temple that appears to have been made from some form of great tree that has fossilized, or otherwise been turned to
    stone. At the ground floor is the sanctuary, filled with engraved wooden pews and a raised stage with a simple alter styled like a coffin, with a small graveyard
    behind the temple. On the second floor is a series of storage and worship rooms, along with a few classrooms in which the clergy teach reading, writing and singing.
    The third floor is where the temple's treasury and the clergy's bedrooms are located. The temple appears, from the outside, to raise up at least 5 more stories,
    but they have not been carved out.
</p>
<p>
    The actual temple of the Temple of the First Lich is not to be used for bardic functions, as they could disturb the "resting." Instead, bardic functions of the
    Temple of the First Lich are done at a second temple several streets down from the main temple.
</p>
<p>
    The secondary temple is a 2 story building made of lime plastered cob, heavily featuring curved exterior walls with bright paintings, and a thatched roof. The first 
    floor holds a gallery in which local art pieces are placed on public display, with the second story consisting of a small library and 4 large rooms that are used 
    either as classrooms or as quiet places to practice.
</p>
<p>
    Next to the secondary temple is an ampitheater made of plastered sandstone bricks, which is used for plays and major musical performances. Behind the secondary
    temple rests a single story, wattle and daub building that houses the typical lindite bar and the sleeping quarters for the clergy and students of the secondary
    temple.
</p>

<h3 id="border-beer">The Border Beer</h3>
<p>
    The Border Beer is a single story building made from gray rock-dust bricks with 2 windows beside the front door, which is made from woven shrub wood.
    Inside the Border Beer is two rooms, a large main serving room with a single, large table made from compressed sawdust that seats 30 and a bar made from
    magically created stone (wall of stone) that seats 10, with a single fireplace along the eastern wall, and a storage room in the back which holds stocks
    of booze and a small kitchen. The Border Beer is closed from lunch until dinner and offers no sleeping arrangements.
</p>
<p>
    The Border Beer is owned and operated by <a href="#celna-finepeak">Celna Finepeak</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="dead-wood-dozery">Dead Wood Dozery</h3>
<p>
    Made from gray, colorless wood planks backed with dried mud, the Dead Wood Dozery stands only a story tall with a front door made from a mix of pine wood and
    brass planks with iron nails. Immediately inside the Dead Wood Dozery is a room with a single, copper desk and 3 couches where customers can pay for rooms.
    Connected to the entry room is a hallway with 8 doors, 4 of which lead to rooms that contain beds big enough to sleep 8, which are rented by bed space, while the
    other 4 rooms contain beds large enough to sleep 3, which are rented as rooms. Each of the rentable rooms contains a chamber pot and window with shudders.
    All the bed frames are made from brass.
</p>
<p>
    The Dead Wood Dozery is owned and operated by <a href="#varee-shadowdream">Varee Shadowdream</a>.

<h3 id="broken-branch-goods">Broken Branch Goods</h3>
<p>
    Broken Branch Goods is long, dirt mound style building with a door made from preserved prairie grass and brushwood. The main room contains a small customer
    area and magically created stone (wall of stone) counter, with a door behind it that leads deeper into the store. When opened, a storage area can be seen
    through the door behind the counter with a second door visible. For those with the pleasure to see both doors open, a small living area lies past the
    second door.
</p>
<p>
    Broken Branch Goods sells general goods as well as instrument supplies (such as lute strings and reeds) and holy water.
