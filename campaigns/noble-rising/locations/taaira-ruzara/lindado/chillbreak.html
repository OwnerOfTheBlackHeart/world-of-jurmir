<p>
    Adjeon is a 5' 5" tall male elf with flowing chestnut hair that is woven into something resembling a cape, plenty of fat (for an elf at least),
    pale skin (even for an elf), and dark, green eyes. Adjeon wears a mish-mash of clothing and jewelry that was made by "expert artisans" with 
    great pride and well spin long tales of how he acquired each piece. The acute observer may note that his clothes aren't exclusively elven in style,
    and many pieces are even human or dwarvish.

    a large feast or a fire orange binder (that does little to hide her bust) under a tight fitting wolf-hide vest with a giant viper skin skirt.
    When it's cold, Xiiserra will add a hooded bear hide coat, while in hotter months she'll keep an unremarkable leather cloak on hand, in case of rain

    Unlike other catfolk, Thirrarris doesn't wear any charms in her hair. Thirrarris typically wears a green chiengora (dog wool) shirt that
    loosely drapes off her torso with bone stud earings and woven twig necklaces. During the colder months, Thirrarris will wear a heavier
    chiengora shirt. When in her store, Thirrarris rarely wears leg/waist coverings, relying on her shirt to cover halfway down the thighs.
    If she does wear leg coverings, Thirrarris wears a leather or wool skirt of length appropriate to the season/heat.
</p>
<p>

<h3 id="boll-and-sons">Boll and Sons Beer and Bed</h3>
<p>
    Boll and Sons is a large-ish building made of a rough timber main build and several wattle and daub extensions. Inside the main
    building is the bar itself, with 12 round tables, seating 6 each, a palm wood bar that seats 9 and 8 hammocks hanging on the
    outer walls. The extensions, accessed through the main building, lead to a pair of rentable "planning rooms" that each contain
    a large table and some modicum of privacy, and a large room that offers barracks style sleeping arrangements.

    Built with a foot tall, round stone foundation, Sixteen Nails is a 2 story wattle and daub building with a seeming lack of nails.
    The ground floor is dirt floored and is filled with shelves, with the counter placed at the back of the building on a raised platform.
    While food, animal feed and rope is kept up front, all of the valuable tools and miscellaneous goods are kept in the back, retrieved
    upon request.
</p>
<p>
    Sixteen Nails is a general goods store, selling food, tools, animal feed, and more miscellaneous goods.

<h3 id="gentle-breeze-herbs">Gentle Breeze Herbs</h3>
<p>
    Gentle Breeze is a round, mud hut built into the roots of a grove of mangroves, which itself is surrounded by a small area of artificial swamp.
    The walkway to the shop is made of tight fit, natural stones and leads from the edge of the swamp to the Gentle Breeze at its center. The inside
    of the shop is sunken 3 feet into the ground and lined with druidically shaped wooden shelves behind a druidically shaped counter, all from the
    mangrove roots. At the furthest point behind the counter is a ladder leading through the mud roof.
</p>
<p>
    Gentle Breeze primarily sells herbs which are used in medicine, though it also sells spell components, recreational herbs, all-natural paints and
    pigments, and some complete alchemical medicines.
</p>
<p>
    Gentle Breeze Herbs is owned by <a href="#thirrarris">Thirrarris Burning Log</a>.

<h3 id="stables">The Stables</h3>
<p>
    The village stables is a large, wooden barn attached to a wattle and daub house, which serves as the only stables within the main village itself,
    housing the animals of travelling merchants and slayers while they stay in Chillbreak. While the stables are of rather unremarkable construction, 
    they are well kept and well tended.

<p>
    The Stables are owned and operated by <a href="robyn-hunt">Robyn</a>.

<h3 id="artland">The Artland</h3>
<p>
    The Artland is an ampitheater with the stage, seating, and half-dome all seemingly made from one piece of stone, specifically marble. The venue
    itself can conformably fit 300 observers at once while the stage gives enough space for a reasonably large play. Normally the Artland remains
    quiet and unused, though it may be rented out for paid performances or just used for practice and free performances. The Artland has finely tuned
    acoustics and a solid stage whisper can be heard all the way in the rearmost seats, assuming the audience is quiet.
</p>
<p>
    The Artland is maintained by <a href="xilzira-dixon">Xilzira</a>.
</p>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm noble-full chillbreak-full artland-construction">

<h3 id="lura-manor">Lura Manor</h3>
<p>
    The Lura Manor is a 3 story building made of 4 stone pillars on each side with painted wattle and daub walls between them, an elaborate garden in the
    front courtyard and 2 external kitchens in the rear courtyard, and a wrought iron fence surrounding the property. The only rooms that those who don't
    live in Lura Manor see are the sitting room, the ballroom and the courtroom.
</p>
<p>
    Compared to higher nobility's homes, the sitting room of Lura Manor is rather small, though the walls are filled with a seemingly random collection of 
    paintings, display pieces and statues, with fine carpets and embroidered pillows covering the room itself. The ballroom takes up 2 stories and almost
    half of the first floor, with a prominent stage at the end of the ballroom and many well made, if mismatched, statues line the walls. The courtroom
    is little more than a large office with a desk for the judge/mayor, defendant and prosecutor, though the courtroom is used more by
    Inquisitor <a href="#ulril-jones">Jones</a> than by the mayor.
</p>
<p>
    Lura Manor is the primary residence of mayor <a href="#adjeon-lura">Lura</a>.

<p>
    <a href="#yeshana-numuas">Yeshana</a> works as mayor <a href="#adjeon-lura">Lura</a>'s personal assistant. She is in charge of greeting guests,

<h3 id="ten-gods-temple">The Ten Gods Temple</h3>
<p>
    A relatively simple temple made from wooden planks and stained glass, the Ten Gods Temple of Chillbreak is beautiful, if not a little simple.
    The ground floor of the building contains the sanctuary itself, with pews lining the room leading up to a "stage" with a central altar placed
    upon it, with a shrine to each of the ten major gods along the curved wall behind the altar. Taking the stairs near the entry doors leads one
    to either the basement, which handles mortuary duties and holds the dining hall for the temple's clergy, or the second story, where the clergy's
    bed chambers, study and libraries are. Behind the main church building is a small wattle and daub kitchen with an attached storeroom.

<h3 id="tsvetoks-pond">Tsvetok's Pond</h3>
<p>
    At the edge of a rather lively pond is a mound of flower covered dirt, roughly 4 feet tall. The top of the mound is flat, and during ceremonies,
    a white and green cloth is placed over the top of the mound. About 100 feet from the shrine is a small maintenance shed built into a naturally
    occurring cave. The area surrounding the pond is well groomed and looks like a flower garden.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="#nera-smiling-hawk">Nera Smiling Hawk</a> is the priestess of Tsvetok, spending much of her time either maintaining the area around Tsvetok's
    pond or preparing materials for the next ritual to be performed.
</p>
<p>
    Tsvetok is an inconspicuous looking water lily at the center of the pond. However, regardless of the time of year, Tsvetok is healthy and in
    bloom. 
</p>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm noble-full chillbreak-full tsvetok-powers">
    <p>
        Outside of always being healthy and in bloom, Tsvetok has the ability to telepathically speak to those who enter its pond, though rarely does so.
        It also has control of all flowers within its hex and can perceive distant locations through them. Tsvetok also possesses the power to force those
        that try to attack it to instead will to protect it. The only protection from Tsvetok's protective powers is to wear a crown made from the dead wood
        of a tree from the dead forest, after which Tsvetok can be snipped or burned.
    </p>
</ap-auth-container>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm noble-full chillbreak-full tsvetok-divinity">
    <p>
        Tsvetok is a minor god with the portfolio of flowers, clean water, and revitalization. Tsvetok's followers believe that it is only a matter of
        time before the dead forest at the base of the Mount of Decay will once again flourish with life, and that Tsvetok will aid them in seeding
        the forest's new life. Some even claim that Tsvetok is using its own magic to keep the decay of the forest from spreading.
