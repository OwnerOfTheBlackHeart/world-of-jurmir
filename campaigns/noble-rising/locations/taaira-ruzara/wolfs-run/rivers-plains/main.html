<h1>The Barony of Rivers Plains</h1>
<p>
	Nera's barony.

<p>
	The following rules will eventually be moved to a separate page.
</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>
<ap-advanced-table>
	[
		[{ "value": "", "isHeader": true, "columnAlign":"right" }, { "value": "Resource Count", "isHeader": true, "align":"center", "columnAlign":"left" }],
		[{ "value": "Goods", "isHeader": true }, "0"],
		[{ "value": "Labor", "isHeader": true }, "2"],
		[{ "value": "Influence", "isHeader": true }, "1"],
		[{ "value": "Magic", "isHeader": true }, "0"]
	]
</ap-advanced-table>
<p>
	<i class="power">Goods:</i> Goods represent physical items necessary for an activity, which can be permanent fixtures or consumable items. For building an inn, 
	Goods are the materials used to build the structure, the tables and chairs, and the food and beverages you plan to sell. Goods as capital 
	are an abstraction so that you don’t need to keep track of gathering things like stones for a building’s foundation, timber for the walls, 
	ingredients for the menu, and so on. Goods might also represent natural resources (such as fertile soil or a spring), in which case you’re 
	not literally moving these items to a specific location — instead, you’re spending capital to acquire a location with those resources.
</p>
<p class="indent-1">
	<i class="power">Food:</i> A special subvariety of Goods, Food represents the raw food that feeds a community. Excess food is automatically converted to goods
	at a rate of 5 Food to 1 Good. 1 unit of Food feeds 10 population, rounding up. If you don't have enough Food income to feed your population generated, you lose 1 Goods per
	10 population, rounding up.
</p>
<p>
	<i class="power">Influence:</i> Influence represents your ability to get other people in the settlement to perform favors for you or use their skills to 
	accomplish things (as opposed to Labor, which involves hard physical work). This includes getting a merchant to change the terms of a contract, or convincing 
	a politician to do you a favor.
</p>
<p>
	<i class="power">Labor:</i> Labor represents using workers to accomplish tasks. This includes hiring carpenters to construct a building, hiring thugs to 
	extort shopkeepers, using assistants to help you craft items or tend injuries, or hiring employees to run your business while you’re away. For every 10 population
	that isn't working, 1 Labor is generated.
</p>
<p>
	<i class="power">Magic:</i> Magic represents magical power at your disposal. Some activities, such as healing sick peasants in the slums or constructing a 
	magical library, specifically require you to spend Magic.
</p>

<h2>Acquiring Resources</h2>
<ap-advanced-table>
	[
		[{ "value": "", "isHeader": true, "columnAlign":"right" }, { "value": "Purchase Cost", "isHeader": true, "align":"center", "columnAlign":"left" }],
		[{ "value": "Goods", "isHeader": true }, "200gp"],
		[{ "value": "Food", "isHeader": true }, "50gp"],
		[{ "value": "Labor", "isHeader": true }, "200gp"],
		[{ "value": "Influence", "isHeader": true }, "300gp"],
		[{ "value": "Magic", "isHeader": true }, "1,000gp"]
	]
</ap-advanced-table>

<h3>Purchasing Resources</h3>
<p>
	Resources can be purchased with gold, which is more expensive than building up the resources over time. When purchasing resources, you gain the resources
	immediately. This may represent paying carpenters from the next settlement over to help bolster your own carpenters, or it might represent buying the wood
	from another barony.
</p>
<p>
	The prices listed in the table above represent the cost of buying one unit of resources. Excess Goods, Labor and Magic can be sold for profit, at a return
	of half their purchase cost.
</p>

<h3>Earning Resources</h3>
<p>
	Resources can be passively earned over time by buildings or improvements that are manned, once per month. Buildings that are not manned do not produce
	resources.
</p>

<h2>Population</h2>
<ap-advanced-table>
	[
		[{ "value": "Population Type", "isHeader": true, "columnAlign":"right" }, { "value": "Purchase Cost", "isHeader": true, "align":"center", "columnAlign":"left" }],
		[{ "value": "Untrained", "isHeader": true, "align":"right" }, "5gp"],
		[{ "value": "Trained", "isHeader": true, "align":"right" }, "15gp"],
		[{ "value": "Arcane", "isHeader": true, "align":"right" }, "100gp"],
		[{ "value": "Divine", "isHeader": true, "align":"right" }, "75gp"],
		[{ "value": "Combatant, minor", "isHeader": true, "align":"right" }, "10gp"],
		[{ "value": "Combatant, medium", "isHeader": true, "align":"right" }, "500gp"],
		[{ "value": "Combatant, major", "isHeader": true, "align":"right" }, "15,000gp"],
		[{ "value": "Combatant, heroic", "isHeader": true, "align":"right" }, "500,000gp"]
	]
</ap-advanced-table>
<p>
	Combatants range in level from 1st to 12th, with minors being 1st to 3rd, mediums being 4th to 6th, majors being 7th to 9th, and heroics being
	10th to 12th. Within each combatant category, there is 5 lower level combatants for each level higher. For example, if you have 12 Combatant, minors, then you have
	10 at level 1 and 2 at level 2. You would get your first level 3 once you have 31 combatant, minors, which would be 25 at level 1, 5 at level 2, and 1 at level 3.
