			Morasha is a 5' 2" tall, female pantherfolk with an average build, DD cup titties, light green eyes and head hair kept so short it
			blends into her fur. Morasha has silvery tattoos that run along her head and arms which change color when she casts, either to green
			when she is calling upon animal or plant magic, or the appropriate color when summoning forth elemental magic. Morasha normally wears
			a green cloak and scarf over a lightweight brown sleeveless shirt with sturdy brown leather pants. She also wears wraps around her
			wrists and forearms, as well as an ironwood ring inset with a sapphire.
		</p>
		<p>
			Morasha's favored wild shape form is that of a tiger, as she likes the stripes.
		</p>
		<p>
			Morasha is working in Blackhide as a part of Nera's Economic Druid Policy
		</p>
		<p>
			When assigned to a small farm, Morasha will produce 1 extra food. When assigned to a large farm, Morasha will produce 2 extra food.
