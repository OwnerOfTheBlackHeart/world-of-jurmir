    <p>
        The <ap-link-button linkName="noble-followers-of-the-pearl-cat">Followers of the Pearl Cat</ap-link-button>, a cult worshiping a pearl statue of a cat and the
        ideal of generosity, is based in Silverwood. The cult is relatively small and only a scant few have spread beyond Silverwood.

<h3 id="anemeo">Anemeo Statuespeaker Agu-Vigo Kelly</h2>
<p>
    Anemeo is a 7' 8" tall, sturdily build goliath female with D cup titties, long, straight black hair and brilliant blue eyes. Anemeo usually wears a spider silk dress
    she bought from a "nice" drow, which is opaque enough to hide her skin but thin enough that the dark spots of her lithoderms and molting show through the dress.
</p>
<p>
    Anemeo is gentle and friendly, though if she is forced to talk to people for too long she will shutdown and become silent. Anemeo doesn't like accolades and would
    rather help someone else do something great that do that great thing herself.
</p>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm noble-full wolfs-run-full anemeo-history">
    <p>
        When they were young, Anemeo and Zaukin showed signs of not being competitive enough to be able to operate in goliath society. When their mother was trading with
        a childless farmer named Eli Kelly, she decided to trade off her two children to the farm for some grain. After taking the twins home, Eli raised them as if they
        were his own, teaching them more human values of cooperation.

        Anemeo is of the two priests of the Pearl Cat, along with her brother <a href="#zaukin">Zaukin</a>, who she was with when she found the statue.

<h3 id="zaukin">Zaukin Catfinder Agu-Vigo Kelly</h2>
<p>
    Zaukin is a 7' 7" tall, goliath male with a thin build (for a goliath) and brilliant blue eyes. He typically wears a white leather robe that exposes most of his chest
    and arms, displaying his lithoderms and molting, as well as vibrantly colored tattoos that contrast and emphasize his skin patterns.
</p>
<p>
    Zaukin is upbeat and friendly, and loves to hear the stories others are willing to tell. Unlike a typical goliath, Zaukin believes that the only person he has to compete
    with is himself.
