	<h2>GM Notes</h2>
	<p>
		The highest leader of Antys is the Arch Mage of Antys who handles immediate problems as
		they come up. While the Arch Mage has executive power, legislative power is held by the
		Council of Knowledge and Wisdom, of which the Arch Mage serves as the chairman. The Council
		is made up of the Arch Mage, the head mage of each of the eight schools of magic, the high 
		priest from each of the 5 elven churches, and the 4 elder druids.
