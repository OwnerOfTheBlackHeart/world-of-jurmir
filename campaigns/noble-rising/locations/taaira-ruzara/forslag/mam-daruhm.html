<p>
	The Teamsters' and Porters' Economic Alliance of Taaira Ruzara is an organization made up of several guilds across
	Taaira Ruzara that cover porters and teamsters who handles collecting and distributing transportation jobs, both
	singular and recurring. The Alliance also serves to ensure that trade routes and roads are maintained and protected,
	though the guild does not offer any mercenary services to help in this task. For protection, the Alliance typically
	relies on local guards and slayers.

		returns approximately 0.15% of their weight back.

<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h3 id="clockwork-factorum">The Clockwork Factorum</h3>
<p>
	The Clockwork Factorum is a massive, rectangular, 2 story building carved from the stone around it with a perfectly smooth exterior
	and a 7 foot tall, bronze statue of <ap-link-button linkName="zigies">Zigies</ap-link-button> angel form hanging over the 9 foot tall
	entry doors. Immediately inside the Factorum is a hallway with three doors: a person sized wooden door leading to the factory itself,
	a person sized, steel bar door leading to a "shop" where projects can be ordered, and a pair of doors nearly as large as the entry doors
	that leads to the sanctuary.
</p>
<p>
	The factory itself is overwhelming for the uninitiated, temporarily blinding and deafening them until they exit and look away. To those
	initiated into the worship of <ap-link-button linkName="zigies">Zigies</ap-link-button>, the factory is a beautiful work of art made from
	brass, bronze, steel and steam that remains in a constant state of motion. Stations exist for nearly every form of crafting available,
	all of which contain moving machines that make the task easier and quicker. 
	<ap-auth-container permissions="gm mam-daruhm-full noble-full clockwork-factorum-machines" inline>
		Crafting at one of the stations within the Clockwork Factorum doubles the progress, or loss, from a crafting check.
	</ap-auth-container>
</p>
<p>
	The shop is fairly basic, with depictions of <ap-link-button linkName="zigies">Zigies's</ap-link-button> awakening and the creation of the
	first warforged carved into the walls, a slate counter and an adamantine plated warforged that is cleaning whenever no one is at the counter. 
	Clipboards and sheets of parchment sit in organized bins behind the counter.
</p>
<p>
	The sanctuary is a 60 foot by 700 foot chamber with an 8 foot tall ceiling and 4 rows of stone pews with copper colored cushions. The
	carvings in the walls and ceiling are inlaid with silver. The altar resembles a large blacksmith's forge with a spotless bronze table attached,
	but no tools, clothe coverings or tools are present outside of ceremonies. The room is shaped in such a way that if one is at the altar 
	and speaks loudly, the entire room can hear them.
</p>
<p>
	The Clockwork Factorum is headed by <a href="#nustar-grimshield">Craftmaster Nustar Grimshield</a>.

<h3 id="the-bloodworks">The Bloodworks</h3>

	carved into the outer walls. The entry door is a 3 person wide steel door that leads into an open room with a raised platform, upon which sits an empty
	stone cross with several bloody knives and a drain below it. Several feet behind the cross is a door that leads into the alchemical factory, which
	is indented 2 stories into the ground with 4 large tanks, a small maze of brass and steel tubes, seemingly countless alembics, a stack of 6 drying plates and a forge.
	A set of two boilers power the Bloodworks.

	wheels, 8 bins filled with raw ore and 4 bins filled with coal, 16 piles of ore that, when the mine is in operation, are worked by dwarves with sledgehammers, a large,
	industrial smelter and, occasionally, a wagon that picks up the processed metal.
</p>
<p>
	The mine itself is a twisting complex of tunnels, with wood and stone railways, that snakes around, and through, a massive, cooled magma spire. Inside the spire is where
	most of the gold group metals are found, while the iron, tin and zinc are found in different varieties outside the spire. The swarm of dwarves that works the mine are
	constantly working, using pickaxes, chisels and hammers to break up and work the stone. Navigation instructions are written on the walls in paint that can only be seen
	with darkvision.
</p>
<p>
	Magmaspire Mines produces gold, copper, lead, mercury, silver, iron, tin, and zinc.

<p>
	The Magmaspire Mines are managed by <a href="#ber-emerstrength">Overseer Ber Emberstrength</a>.

<h3 id="warehouses">The Warehouses</h3>
<p>
	Located near the entrance of Mam Daruhm is the Warehouses, a group of 30 two-story, stone buildings 25 feet wide by 60 feet deep. Each warehouse has a main door that is
	large enough for a whole wagon to fit through and a single person side door, both of which have a stopping bar, as well as a 20 foot deep loft at the front and back of
	the warehouse.
</p>
<p>
	The Warehouses are available for rent, but they also serve as a place for traders to sell to the city in bulk. Most guilds in the city keep a representative near the
	Warehouses to purchase goods for the guild to resell to its members.
