<h2>Organizations and Monsters</h2>
<h3>Teamsters' and Porters' Economic Alliance of Taaira Ruzara</h3>
<p>
	The Teamsters' and Porters' Economic Alliance of Taaira Ruzara is an organization made up of several guilds across
	Taaira Ruzara that cover porters and teamsters who handles collecting and distributing transportation jobs, both
	singular and recurring. The Alliance also serves to ensure that trade routes and roads are maintained and protected,
	though the guild does not offer any mercenary services to help in this task. For protection, the Alliance typically
	relies on local guards and slayers.
</p>

<h3>The Slayers' Guild</h3>
<p>
	The Slayers' Guild is an organization responsible for managing a social caste known as "slayers" who are hired to kill 
	monsters, criminals, and enemies of the state or retrieve objects from monsters and/or dungeons. The Slayers' Guild 
	is the largest source of jobs for slayers in Keldhall, but has been suffering from a reduction of slayers as of late. 
	It uses the same ranking system as the Slayers' Guild of Mensharra.
</p>
<p>
	The two most common jobs for slayers in Keldhall are clearing out areas of the forests of animals and hunting down bandits.
</p>

<h3>Woodcutters' Guild</h3>
<p>

</p>

<h3>Shipbuilders' Guild</h3>
<p>

</p>

<h3>Mercers' (textile merchants) Guild</h3>
<p>
	They mostly sell to the large number of travelling merchants and the dwarves of Mam Daruhm.
</p>

<h3>The Mayoral Council</h3>
<p>
	The Mayoral Council is a group in charge of electing the mayor of Keldhall every 10 years. The Council is made up of 5
	members that are elected by the merchant class that can acquire one of the 101 voter's licenses every 5 years. While the
	mayor handles day to day administrative duties and the drafting of laws, the Mayoral Council is in charge of accepting
	or denying any laws and budgets the mayor presents.
</p>
<p>
	The Mayoral Council does not choose who is running for mayor, only which of the final 2 candidates becomes mayor. When
	time for a new major rolls around, the mayor selects 3 candidates (possibly including themselves) and the town guilds
	may elect up to 7 candidates, which the 101 voters then vote on, with the 2 most popular going to the Mayoral Council
	for the final vote.
</p>
<p>
	The Mayoral Council is elected via the local guilds, with a spot reserved for a representative of the local duke.

	guilds that can handle joining, leaving, and lodging complaints with the guild as well as a basic kitchen and eating area at the
	back of the first floor. The second floor holds 8 large rooms in which basic training, meetings and lectures can be held. The

<h3>Template</h3>
<p>
	Oops is a stout building barely sized to fit humans made of mud with a poorly cared for white wash. Inside the building,
	similarly white washed pillars, with plenty of scaring, support the low roof. In the main room are alchemically reinforced
	glass shelves filled with ingredients and alchemically created materials, with a scorched wooden counter that Prilin
	Fockle normally works behind. In the back are three smaller rooms: A mixing room for combining ingredients, a firing
	room for burning, firing, and baking materials, and a storage room where the base ingredients are kept away from fires
	and explosions.
</p>
<p>
	Explosive, reactive, and quickly decaying materials are made upon request and are only kept in storage for 24 hours.
