<h1>The Country of Sokjin</h1>
<p>
    Sokjin is an asain polity where the old races have banded together to control and maintain
    power over human-kind. Most sokjini believe that the Red King is waiting for the number of
    humans to reach a certain point at which he will raise and use them as his army to wipe out
    the gods.
</p>
<p>
    The sokjini control the humans via a curse that prevents insemination without having the
    elven Ritual of Fertility performed on both of the parents. They also have made it illegal
    for the human sokjini from learning magic, for fear that they will learn how to perform the
    Ritual of Fertility themselves and begin reproducing out of control.
</p>
<p>
    Most sokjini humans accept this as a fact of life and have far less issue with recreational 
    sex than other humans. However, a small portion of the human sokjini regularly rebel (both 
    violently and non-violently) against not having control over their ability to have children
    and the fact that they are not legally allowed to wield magic.
</p>
<p>
    Those human sokjini that are born with magic or learn magic are quickly hunted down by
    inquisitors of all races. Few are captured alive, but those that are get tortured for any
    and all information they have about how they learned magic. The inquisitors will also chase
    down runaway humans.
</p>
<p>
    In Sokjin dragons are considered holy creatures and Kyranious is the most commonly worshipped
    god, closely followed by Kriotz.

<p>
    Sokjin is known to have several schools of magic, with a thriving wizardry community. There
    is also an abundance of low level clerics granted spells by the local living gods.
