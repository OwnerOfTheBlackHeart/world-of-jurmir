<h2>Notable Peoples</h2>
<h3>Zita, Speaker of Durn</h3>
<p>
    A small and frail aasmar standing just under 5 feet tall, the golden fleshed white haired Zita is the Speaker of
    Durn for the faith within Arx and is officially the head of the Cult of Durn, which rules over Lyrna. She typically
    wears the gold and white robes of the Cult of Durn with a platnum crown inlaid with pearls, and keeps a sickle at 
    her waist.
</p>
<p>
    The title of Speaker of Durn passed to Zita after the last speaker, Orthia, died durning childbirth 3 years ago.
    Zita puts on an appearance of kindness and humbility, but Zita is powerhungry and sneaky. While she does live by
    the tenants of Durn, she may employ less righteous to maintain and grow her power base. She is a powerful cleric.
    She is only 19 and is considered to be youthful for her role and often believed to be far more naive than she
    truly is.
</p>
<h3>Lethos, Lion of Arx</h3>
<p>
    Lethos is a small, 5' 8" male orc clad in gold and red full plate. On his tabard is the skull of Sithrak with
    a sickle around it. He has long, jet black hair that is kept in a ponytail that reaches to his waist and piercing
    red eyes. He has many small scars across his face.
</p>
<p>
    Lethos is the paladin who serves directly under High Priestess Zita. He serves with unwavering silence and stillness.
    Before he served Zita, he fought against the paladins of Arx and was defeated. He was then inducted into survice of
    the faith. He had his tongue removed for speaking out against Durn nearly a decade ago. He often serves as the most
    aggressive hand of the faith. Lethos is called the Lion of Arx after the roar that he unleashes before entering battle.
</p>
<h3>Theas, Herald of Feph</h3>
<p>
    Theas is a mid-40s human male who is just beginning to lose his short, brown hair. Theas wears leather robes that are
    green with brown trims and have a stylized wolf with an eagle on its back. He stands at 5' 10" and has soft features.
</p>
<p>
    Theas is known as the wisest of the clergy within Arx and is often quick to recognize signs sent by Feph. When new signs
    are spotted, Theas is often called upon to interpret them and reveal any significance. Unlike most of the faith within
    Arx, Feph is Theas's prime diety.
</p>
<h3>Dyri Englisson</h3>
<p>
    Dyri stands at 3' 2" with bright yellow hair, cloudy blue eyes, and middling age. The gnome has a growing beer belly as he 
    joyfully hobbles around his shop. He wears nice clothes with bright colors and silver jewelry.
</p>
<h3>Hanef</h3>
<p>
    This mithral clad warforged stands at 6' 3" with the typically impressive form. It wears a basic cloth shirt and pants
    and speaks with a cheerful demenior. It uses male pronouns to describe itself. Hanef owns Zoltan's Watering Hole.
</p>
<h3>Ingirun Thorlakdottir</h3>
<p>
    Ingirun is a 6' tall female half-orc with the musculature of a working man. She has pale green skin and bristly black
    hair. She is, unsuprisingly, short tempered, but quite patient when it comes to working metal. She normally wears
    clothing made from corn stalk with a thick leather apron with many burn marks on it. She owns the Fire and Thunder
    Forges.
</p>
<h3>Yri Grimdottir</h3>
<p>
    Yri is the 5' 5" human owner of the First and Last Shop. She is pale with squinting blue eyes and light brown hair.
    She has generally soft features and a large scar going up her left arm. She is skinny and wears nice furs with simple
    tin jewelry. She is friendly, but doesn't like people trying to rip her off.
</p>
<h3>Tosti Dyrisson</h3>
<p>
    Tosti stands at 3' 8" with dull yellow hair and cloudy blue eyes. He generally wears protective leather clothing and
    carries several pieces of parchment and charcoal. The small gnome is often surrounded by other working persons as
    he gives advice and direction. He is the son of Dryi Englisson and a foreman.
</p>

<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h3>Zoltan's Watering Hole</h3>
<p>
    Zoltan's Watering Hole is part bar, part inn, and part casino. Several dice and card games fill tables within the
    establishment while Hanef works the bar. Much of the inside of the building has depictions of Zoltan.
    The bar is active at most times of the day, with rooms on a second floor that sits over rentable rooms with tables.
</p>
<h3>The First and Last Shop</h3>
<p>
    No one knows exactly what they will need until they need it. This is the premise behind the First and Last Shop, a
    general goods store optimized to allow for goods to be found and purchased quickly and with ease. Everything within
    the store is organized and marked with easy to read signs. The shop is run by Yri Grimdottir.
</p>
<h3>Touch of Kriotz</h3>
<p>
    A small and humble hole in the wall shop run by Dyri Englisson. All of the magic items are locked in cabnets and
    displays, most of which are enchanted with defensive spells to protect the merchandise. There is no particular
    organization to the products, but small name tags generally tell what the items might do.
</p>
<h3>Fire and Thunder Forges</h3>
<p>
    Due to the number of paladins, guardsmen, nobles, and inquisitors in Arx the Fire and Thunder Forges is typically
    buisy forging weapons and armor of varying qualities. Three smiths dot the forge, but Ingirun Thorlakdottir is clearly
    the owner. The forge does also produce normal goods, but that is not the bulk of its production.
