<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h3>The Castle</h3>
<p>
    Large castle at the center of town. Built out of a strange black stone and is visible 
    anywhere in the city. The inside of the castle is constantly busy with slaves, scribes, and members of the 
    Judges going to and from the maze of hallways and rooms that make up the interior of the castle.
</p>
<p>
    The castle's top floor is a Hall of Heroes, prominently showing Drust Grifter and his small army of slaves.
    The Hall of Heroes leads to the main worship chamber which holds a 12 foot tall statue of Sithrak along with
    3 skeleton embers on either side of the statue.
</p>

<h3>Public Records Building (PRB)</h3>
<p>
    Throughout the city of Seablood there are 16 different PRBs, each built exactly the same. Each PRB has 6 lanes
    which each house a single worker who sells law books, hands out updates, and handles the paperwork for ownership,
    claims, and public records requests. If a PRB can't handle a request, they can usually route a person to the 
    correct place for the request.
</p>
<p>
    PRBs are built of wood plank with dark red roofs and Sithrak skulls beside the door. The inside is a single room
    that can handle about 35 occupants with two statues of skeletons with war scythes. A single worker stands outside
    the lanes, handling the routing of customers, either sending them to an open lane or giving them a number. Above
    each lane, which is a counter with bars and a metal bin for moving items between the sides of the lane, is a set
    of 3 metal dials that rotate to form the number that the lane is ready to handle.
</p>

<h3>The Unjudged Sin</h3>
<p>
    A common adventurer tavern run by ex-adventurer Skyla Kennarde. The main bar area is relatively
    small with only a few round tables, but planning and party rooms are available for rent as are rooms on the second floor.
    The bottom of the building is made from round stone and the floor is dirt, but the second floor is made from brick and
    iron.
</p>
<p>
    Dwarven fire whiskey is always kept in stock and may be purchased for 75 gp per bottle. Several drinks made by Underdark
    Breweries are also available: Absinthe (110 gp per bottle), Spider's Silk (pua with extra flavor, 150 gp per bottle),
    and Taste of the Underdark (mushroom wine, 80 gp per bottle).
</p>

<h3>Lane's Lane</h3>
<p>
    A simple dug in, brick building with an open main room filled with various general goods from food to animal supplies.
    A counter is near the door behind which the owner, Lane Tatume, stands. Lane's Lane doesn't hold gear specific to
    adventuring.
</p>

<h3>Castle of Glasse</h3>
<p>
    A single story wattle and daub building made to look like a small castle, Castle of Glasse has a main room inside that
    has several shelves with everything from 10 foot poles to alchemist fires and acid along with a cob counter behind which
    Nell Glasse normally works.
</p>

<h3>Tower of Trinkets</h3>
<p>
    A simple, round cob tower that is approximately 40 feet in diameter and 4 stories tall. The main sales area has several
    display cases with various trinkets and magic items, all of which are secured with both mundane and arcane protections.
    The second story contains a proper enchanting lab that, for 500gp rent a day, allows an enchanter to enchant an item at 3
    times the normal rate. The third floor is a library filled with various tomes and notebooks covering a variety of arcane
    topics and costs 50gp a day to rent. The fourth floor is a room for practicing magic that has been enchanted to limit the
    effects of magic that could potentially harm the caster or the building and is open for public use.
</p>
<p>
    The Tower of Trinkets is owned by Lorna Wesleye, who just seems to appear when you need him.
