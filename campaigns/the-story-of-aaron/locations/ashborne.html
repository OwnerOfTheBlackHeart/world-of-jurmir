<h2>Notable Peoples</h2>
<h3>Doris of Arx</h3>
<p>
    The only cleric in Ashborne, Doris has been placed in power as the representative
    of the church of Durn. Despite being only 122 years of age, the young elf does everything
    in her power to run the town fairly. She is somewhat naive and idealistic, allowing
    the local priesthood to exert influence over her.
</p>
<p>
    Doris is clearly not a fighter, with a small and fragile frame that stands at 4' 8".
    Her time in power has given her a little bit of fat on her bones. She has golden hair,
    deep purple eyes, and sunkissed skin. Her hair is kept in a ponytail that ends in the
    small of her back.
</p>
<p>
    Doris perfers to wear the white and gold colors of Durn, and normally wears her priestess
    dress in the courtroom. When she is travelling, she will wear loose fitting chainmail with 
    an apron that bears the symbol of Durn.
</p>

<h3>Hagi Hagison</h3>
<p>
    Hagi runs the Liquid Gold tavern within Ashborne. He prides himself on keeping the most
    friendly tavern in the town and serves his daily customers with his warm smile. During
    the night, his daughter Katla Halldottir.
</p>
<p>
    Hagi is a 51 year old halfling who stands at a rather short 2' 11". He has gental features
    with caramel skin, deep brown hair, and green eyes. He generally wears nice looking, loose 
    leather clothes.
</p>

<h3>Katla Halldottir</h3>
<p>
    Katla works the Liquid Gold tavern within Ashborne at night. She tries to be nice, but
    lacks the gnomesk flair of her father and struggles with a mild temper. She has lighter
    skin than her father, dark red hair, and green eyes. She, much like her father, wears 
    loose leather clothes.
</p>

<h3>Urgg</h3>
<p>
    Urgg is the town blacksmith, owning and working the smithy with inhuman endurance. He
    is generally simple in his speech, but tries to be polite and keep his anger in check.
    If people get him to start complaining, it can take him hours to finally stop himself. 
</p>
<p>
    Urgg is no small orc, standing in at 6' 9" and bulging with scared muscle. Most of the
    scars are small burns and scratches. He has jet black hair, bright red eyes, and gray
    skin.
</p>
<p>
    Urgg normally wears yellow-green wool clothes and may wear a simple leather apron when
    working the forge.
</p>

<h3>Sven Tumisson</h3>
<p>
    Sven is a large, 6' 3" human with a build that would rival Marcus Fenix, bright blond
    hair, and deep blue eyes. He is generally cheery and good tempered, loving a joke that
    helps to lighten up the long day.
</p>
<p>
    Sven dresses in basic linens that are covered in dirt and ripped up.
</p>

<h3>Sabas of Arx</h3>
<p>
    Sabas is an old, and loyal, friend of Doris and the head guard of Ashborne. He is direct in how he
    interacts with people and has little patience for games. He is generally efficient at his job and
    does his best to keep the guards and malitia ready for any surprise orc attacks.
</p>
<p>
    Sabas is a 60 year old human with chocolate skin and muscles only beaten by the guns on Urgg.
    He has black hair and yellow eyes. He has a large scar that goes from his left jaw to his right
    ear.
</p>
<p>
    When on duty, Sabas wears bright white and gold full plate armor with the symbol of Durn on it. When
    off duty, he tends to wear simple earth toned linens and wools.
</p>

<h3>Asny Skorridottir</h3>
<p>
    Asny is a consistently tired female elven guard who is quickly annoyed by sexual advances. She
    tries to do her job as best as she can. She is very elegant and grace when she moves.
</p>
<p>
    Asny stands at 5 feet tall with pale skin, chocolate hair, and green and gold eyes. She keeps her
    hair short enough to easily fit under her helmet. 
</p>

<h3>Skjold Hakisson</h3>
<p>
    The bitter old human wizard of Ashborne who specializes in divinition. He is distrusting of
    others. He seeks to find what the dragon Mirrit is trying to hide. He lives in a dirt tower
    on the outside of town.
</p>
<p>
    Skjold is 72 years old, and looks the part, with silver hair and hazy silvered eyes. Traces
    of gold can be seen if one looks close enough. He stands at 5' 6".
</p>

<h3>Bjor Hrappsson</h3>
<p>
    Bjor is the sterotypical jolly old clergyman. He is the pastor of Durn in ashborne.
    He often works at the temple, not far from Doris. He is often quick to help guide
    the young elf in both spiritual and political matters. He does truly care for Doris
    and the people of Ashborne.
</p>
<p>
    Bjor is almost never found outside of his golden robes, which serve to accentuate the
    elderly gnome's aged features. His hair is the same deep purple as his eyes, but his 
    skin is surprisingly pale. Bjor is 187 years old and stands at 3' 5".
