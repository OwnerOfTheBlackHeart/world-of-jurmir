<h1>Ruined Wizardry School, South of Ashborne</h1>
<p>
    This ancient school of wizardry was abandonded 200 years ago when the lay line that it was built
    over moved. Now the buildings serve as homes for whatever inhabitants decide to make their home
    there.

<h2>Building 1</h2>
<p>
    This is a large stone building of 3 floors. The outside of the building is begining to crumble with
    vines growing up to and from the windows of the building. A large door, roughly 4 persons wide,
    is the only entrance to the building.
</p>
<p>
    The first floor is primarily a large hallway with empty stone pillars that stand around 4 feet tall.
    Along the walls are entrances to many rooms (offices) which appear to have been turned into stables. 
    Off to the west is a set of double doors that lead into a decaying library. A staircase is at the
    east wall, going both up and down.
</p>
<p>
    The second floor is made up of a thin hallway with several large rooms (classrooms) on either side.
    There is a strong, but old, aura of magic here. Most of the walls don't match, and many have burn
    or acid marks on them. Firepits have been made in the centers of the rooms with rolls of animal hide
    surrounding them. The stairs on the eastern wall continue up.
</p>
<p>
    The third floor is more large rooms. Within the rooms are several animal carcasses hanging and
    drying racks with hides on them in the rooms without ceilings.
</p>
<p>
    In the basement is an untouched office, with a spellbook, and a metal door with a powerful magical
    aura. The presense of the door makes non-evil creatures feel uncomfortable. When the door is touched,
    whispers can be heard. Beyond the door is various forms of magical containment holding creatures of
    all types.
</p>
<p>
    Within the basement, only five of the 20+ containment methods still work/contain their prisoners.
    <ul>
        <li>
            A cage with an obsidian black imp with 3 tails, 4 arms, and 6 horns in a line
            Offers magic (free levels in wizard)
        </li>
        <li>
            The skeleton of a satyr frozen in glass
            Offers sight (access to certain div spells per day)
        </li>
        <li>
            A dog covered in quills with the head of a vulture chained to the floor
            Offers might (martial bonuses)
        </li>
        <li>
            A well dressed dwarf sitting on a couch within a magic circle
            Offers wealth (will direct towards wealth)
        </li>
        <li>
            A black fox with a glowing rune on its forhead
            Offers stealth (will grant spells that help with stealth)
        </li>
    </ul>

<h2>Building 2</h2>
<p>
    This is a large ampetheater. Going down from the upper edge are rows of weathered and broken
    stone benches. At the far end is a raised section of stone covered in moss with a large stone
    overhang that appears to have not taken the weather well. Sections of the overhang have crumbled
    to the ground.
</p>
<p>
    The ampetheater has a weak magical aura. No single type can be discerned.
</p>
<ul class="homebrew-list">

</ul>

<h2>Building 3</h2>
<p>
    This building is half stone and half wood. The stone and wood do not appear to be rotted and no
    door blocks the entrance. Those with arcane magic pass through the portal with ease, but those 
    without are stopped by the sudden appearance of a stone wall. If their hand is held by an arcane
    caster, the wall will allow them through.
</p>
<p>
    Inside is an almost untouched labratory, with moss and dust covering everything. The tools here
    are almost unusable, but the stone tables are still in relatively good condition. There are several
    ovens and piles of rotting wood. This building is flooded with powerful magical auras.
