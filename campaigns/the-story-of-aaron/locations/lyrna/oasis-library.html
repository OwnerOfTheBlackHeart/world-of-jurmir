<h1>Oasis Guild Fortress Library</h1>
<p>
    Within the main building of the Oasis Guild Fortress is this library. The library itself is only a floor tall and
    filled with the decaying remains of bookshelves and tables. Some basic sitting areas have been cleared out and a
    small chest filled with books sits at the center of the biggest sitting area. No usuable furnature currently remains.
</p>
<p>
    The books in the library can be studied. If the books are studied for 1 week (7 days), one of two bonuses can be
    acquired: A new spell known (chosen from the spell list below) or a +2 insight (non-stacking) bonus to concentration 
    checks. The new spell is added to the studying character's spellbook or their list of known spells. A character can 
    gain spells that they normally wouldn't be able to with this method. A character can only have a number of spells 
    they could not normally acquire (not on their spell list or they are a spontaneous caster) equal to their caster level. 
    A character cannot use this method to acquire more than double the spells they know in a single spell slot.
</p>
<p>
    For example, a 4th level bard can use this method to acquire up to 4 more spells known than their class would normally
    allow. However, they only know 3 1st level spells. This means that the character can only learn 3 1st level spells (to
    a total of 6 1st level spells known) at level 4 using this method. The 4th level bard can still learn a 0th or 2nd level
    spell.
