<h2>Organizations and Monsters</h2>
<h3>House Duskryn</h3>
<p>
    The scouts of the drow house Duskryn within the city. They have with them at least one matron.
</p>
<h3>Servants of the Red King</h3>
<p>
    A cult of the Red King. It is said that they continue his work to turn humans into an army against the gods. The members
    in Arx are hidden and do much work to disguise their presance and keep the faith from knowning of their treatery against
    the gods.
</p>
<h3>The Red Swans</h3>
<p>
    The local theives guild in Arx. Run by Yom Ki-Nam through a network of lackies and false leaders.
</p>
<h3>Goblins</h3>
<p>
    There is a goblin infestation within the sewers. Damn near mindless, the clever little buggers steal children in the
    night and eat them before they can be found. Their numbers are growing, but no one has noticed.
</p>

<h2>Notable Peoples</h2>
<h3>Zita, Speaker of Durn</h3>
<p>
    A small and frail aasmar standing just under 5 feet tall, the golden fleshed white haired Zita is the Speaker of
    Durn for the faith within Arx and is officially the head of the Cult of Durn, which rules over Lyrna. She typically
    wears the gold and white robes of the Cult of Durn with a platnum crown inlaid with pearls, and keeps a sickle at 
    her waist.
</p>
<p>
    The title of Speaker of Durn passed to Zita after the last speaker, Orthia, died durning childbirth 3 years ago.
    Zita puts on an appearance of kindness and humbility, but Zita is powerhungry and sneaky. While she does live by
    the tenants of Durn, she may employ less righteous to maintain and grow her power base. She is a powerful cleric.
    She is only 19 and is considered to be youthful for her role and often believed to be far more naive than she
    truly is.
</p>
<h3>Lethos, Lion of Arx</h3>
<p>
    Lethos is a small, 5' 8" male orc clad in gold and red full plate. On his tabard is the skull of Sithrak with
    a sickle around it. He has long, jet black hair that is kept in a ponytail that reaches to his waist and piercing
    red eyes. He has many small scars across his face.
</p>
<p>
    Lethos is the paladin who serves directly under High Priestess Zita. He serves with unwavering silence and stillness.
    Before he served Zita, he fought against the paladins of Arx and was defeated. He was then inducted into survice of
    the faith. He had his tongue removed for speaking out against Durn nearly a decade ago. He often serves as the most
    aggressive hand of the faith. Lethos is called the Lion of Arx after the roar that he unleashes before entering battle.
</p>
<h3>Theas, Herald of Feph</h3>
<p>
    Theas is a mid-40s human male who is just beginning to lose his short, brown hair. Theas wears leather robes that are
    green with brown trims and have a stylized wolf with an eagle on its back. He stands at 5' 10" and has soft features.
</p>
<p>
    Theas is known as the wisest of the clergy within Arx and is often quick to recognize signs sent by Feph. When new signs
    are spotted, Theas is often called upon to interpret them and reveal any significance. Unlike most of the faith within
    Arx, Feph is Theas's prime diety.
</p>
<h3>Dyri Englisson</h3>
<p>
    Dyri stands at 3' 2" with bright yellow hair, cloudy blue eyes, and middling age. The gnome has a growing beer belly as he 
    joyfully hobbles around his shop. He wears nice clothes with bright colors and silver jewelry.
</p>
<h3>Hanef</h3>
<p>
    This mithral clad warforged stands at 6' 3" with the typically impressive form. It wears a basic cloth shirt and pants
    and speaks with a cheerful demenior. It uses male pronouns to describe itself. Hanef owns Zoltan's Watering Hole.
</p>

<p>
    Ingirun is a 6' tall female half-orc with the musculature of a working man. She has pale green skin and bristly black
    hair. She is, unsuprisingly, short tempered, but quite patient when it comes to working metal. She normally wears
    clothing made from corn stalk with a thick leather apron with many burn marks on it. She owns the Fire and Thunder
    Forges.
</p>
<h3>Yri Grimdottir</h3>
<p>
    Yri is the 5' 5" human owner of the First and Last Shop. She is pale with squinting blue eyes and light brown hair.
    She has generally soft features and a large scar going up her left arm. She is skinny and wears nice furs with simple
    tin jewelry. She is friendly, but doesn't like people trying to rip her off.
</p>
<h3>Tosti Dyrisson</h3>
<p>
    Tosti stands at 3' 8" with dull yellow hair and cloudy blue eyes. He generally wears protective leather clothing and
    carries several pieces of parchment and charcoal. The small gnome is often surrounded by other working persons as
    he gives advice and direction. He is the son of Dryi Englisson and a foreman.
</p>
<h3>Yom Ki-Nam</h3>
<p>
    Yom stands in at 5' 7" and weighs in at 156 lbs. He has a lean and dense body strutucture with soft feature, squinted
    almont eyes, black hair, and pale skin. He has whip scars on his back that he doesn't show. He wears fine leathers and
    furs that allow for easy access to his crotch and chest, along with 6 golden rings and a silver necklace with a large
    ruby in it.
</p>
<p>
    Yom runs the The Gagged Harpy and the Red Swans. He cares little for the wants and needs of people he deams as "unimportant."
    He is hiding from the sokjini. He runs the Red Swans through several layers of fall guys meant to not only keep the
    sokjini off his trail, but also the Cult of Durn. Especially when it comes to the Gagged Harpy.
</p>
<p>
    Yom only truly values about wealth and loyalty. He is more than willing to pay people to take vengence out on people
    that he believes are going to rat out his operations, however he will use as many layers of fall guys as he can unless
    the assassin/theif is someone he personally trusts to not get caught. He generally believes that power comes from wealth
    and that skill is available for purchase so long as the buyer has enough gold.
</p>

<h2>Notable Locations</h2>
<h3>Zoltan's Watering Hole</h3>
<p>
    Zoltan's Watering Hole is part bar, part inn, and part casino. Several dice and card games fill tables within the
    establishment while Hanef works the bar. Much of the inside of the building has depictions of Zoltan.
    The bar is active at most times of the day, with rooms on a second floor that sits over rentable rooms with tables.
</p>
<h3>The First and Last Shop</h3>
<p>
    No one knows exactly what they will need until they need it. This is the premise behind the First and Last Shop, a
    general goods store optimized to allow for goods to be found and purchased quickly and with ease. Everything within
    the store is organized and marked with easy to read signs. The shop is run by Yri Grimdottir.
</p>
<h3>Touch of Kriotz</h3>
<p>
    A small and humble hole in the wall shop run by Dyri Englisson. All of the magic items are locked in cabnets and
    displays, most of which are enchanted with defensive spells to protect the merchandise. There is no particular
    organization to the products, but small name tags generally tell what the items might do.
</p>
<h3>Fire and Thunder Forges</h3>
<p>
    Due to the number of paladins, guardsmen, nobles, and inquisitors in Arx the Fire and Thunder Forges is typically
    buisy forging weapons and armor of varying qualities. Three smiths dot the forge, but Ingirun Thorlakdottir is clearly
    the owner. The forge does also produce normal goods, but that is not the bulk of its production.
</p>
<h3>The Gagged Harpy</h3>
<p>
    Within the sewers of Arx, hidden from those society would term good, is a slave pen... or brothel, depending on
    perspective. Here the desperate and the moralless come to sate their lusts. The area the Gagged Harpy is set up
    in an expanded area of the sewers. From the waterway, you walk down a set of stairs and enter into the large main
    room which contains a bar, dinning area, and stairway going down. Behind the bar is the access to the kitchen.
    If you go down the stairs you enter into a hallway with doors to small rooms on each side. Within each room is a
    prostitute. Each room has a door with an average lock on it. A small desk with a servant behind it offers time with
    the prostitutes for a modest fee. Several guards patrol the prostitute hallway.
</p>
<p>
    The Gagged Harpy is run by Yom Ki-Nam, who is rumored to be willing to buy and sell prostitutes and to be invovled
    with the theives guild in Arx. Yom typically sits on a mud "throne" covered in pelts on the far side from the bar,
    next to the main room's stage. He almost always has at least two prostitutes leashed up to his throne and 4 bodyguards.
