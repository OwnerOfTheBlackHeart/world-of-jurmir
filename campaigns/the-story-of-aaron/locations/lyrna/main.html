<h1>The Country of Lyrna</h1>
<p>
    Lyrna is a theocratic country ruled by the Cult of Durn, who appoints a Queen of Arx (who is usally 
    also the Speaker of Durn) and ladies of each of the towns. Most of the citizenry within Lyrna is 
    free to do as they please and only lightly ruled over, but laws tend to be strictly enforced.
</p>
<p>
    No particular races rule over Lyrna, but due to the mountains in the west of Lyrna and the large
    plains in the middle of it, Lyrna does have frequent issues with orcs, gnolls, and aggressive clans
    of wild elves. Any of these species are welcomed into the settlements within Lyrna without any concern
    for their past lives, so long as they follow the rules that the Cult of Durn lays out.

    The Cult of Durn wants to take control of Cestrad.
