<h1>The Oasis Guild Fortress</h1>
<p>
    Sitting in the wilds of the Kingdom of Lyrna sits a (slightly) ruined fortress that
    was at one point a school of wizardry. A mix of durable stone construction and a 
    touch of magic have preserved the buildings within for 200 years. Now the aasamar
    Aaron has taken control of the complex, intending to use it as a guild hall.
</p>
<p>
    The complex is made up of an outer wall (repaired in 1488) with 3 sections containing a total of 8
    buildings. The two most prominent being the large tower and the main building.

<h2>Building 1</h2>
<p>
    This is a large stone building of 3 floors. The outside of the building is beginning to crumble with
    vines growing up to and from the windows of the building. A large door, roughly 4 persons wide,
    is the only entrance to the building.
</p>
<p>
    The first floor is primarily a large hallway with empty stone pillars that stand around 4 feet tall.
    Along the walls are entrances to many rooms (offices). Off to the west is a set of double doors that 
    lead into a <ap-link-button linkName="oasis-library">decaying library</ap-link-button> which has been mostly scavenged. A staircase is at the east wall, going 
    both up and down.
</p>
<p>
    The second floor is made up of a thin hallway with several large rooms (classrooms) on either side.
    There is a strong, but old, aura of magic here. Most of the walls don't match, and many have burn
    or acid marks on them. The stairs on the eastern wall continue up.
</p>
<p>
    The third floor is more large rooms.
</p>
<p>
    In the basement is an untouched office, with a spellbook, and a metal door with a powerful magical
    aura. The presence of the door makes non-evil creatures feel uncomfortable. When the door is touched,
    whispers can be heard. Beyond the door is various forms of magical containment holding creatures of
    all types.
</p>
<p>
    Within the basement, only five of the 20+ containment methods still work/contain their prisoners.

<h2>Building 2</h2>
<p>
    This is a large ampitheater. Going down from the upper edge are rows of weathered and broken
    stone benches. At the far end is a raised section of stone covered in moss with a large stone
    overhang that appears to have not taken the weather well. Sections of the overhang have crumbled
    to the ground.
</p>
<p>
    The ampitheater has a weak magical aura. No single type can be discerned.

</p>

<h2>Building 3</h2>
<p>
    This building is half stone and half wood. The stone and wood do not appear to be rotted and no
    door blocks the entrance. Those with arcane magic pass through the portal with ease, but those 
    without are stopped by the sudden appearance of a stone wall. If their hand is held by an arcane
    caster, the wall will allow them through.
</p>
<p>
    Inside is an almost untouched laboratory, with moss and dust covering everything. The tools here
    are almost unusable, but the stone tables are still in relatively good condition. There are several
    ovens and piles of rotting wood. This building is flooded with powerful magical auras.
