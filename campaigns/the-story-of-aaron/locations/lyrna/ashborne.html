<h2 id="important-people">Important People</h2>
<h3>Doris of Arx</h3>
<p>
    The only cleric in Ashborne, Doris has been placed in power as the representative
    of the church of Durn. Despite being only 122 years of age, the young elf does everything
    in her power to run the town fairly. She is somewhat naive and idealistic, allowing
    the local priesthood to exert influence over her.
</p>
<p>
    Doris is clearly not a fighter, with a small and fragile frame that stands at 4' 8".
    Her time in power has given her a little bit of fat on her bones. She has golden hair,
    deep purple eyes, and sunkissed skin. Her hair is kept in a ponytail that ends in the
    small of her back.
</p>
<p>
    Doris prefers to wear the white and gold colors of Durn, and normally wears her priestess
    dress in the courtroom. When she is travelling, she will wear loose fitting chainmail with 
    an apron that bears the symbol of Durn.
</p>

<h3>Hagi Hagison</h3>
<p>
    Hagi runs the Liquid Gold tavern within Ashborne. He prides himself on keeping the most
    friendly tavern in the town and serves his daily customers with his warm smile. During
    the night, his daughter Katla Halldottir.
</p>
<p>
    Hagi is a 51 year old halfling who stands at a rather short 2' 11". He has gental features
    with caramel skin, deep brown hair, and green eyes. He generally wears nice looking, loose 
    leather clothes.
</p>

<h3>Katla Halldottir</h3>
<p>
    Katla works the Liquid Gold tavern within Ashborne at night. She tries to be nice, but
    lacks the gnomesk flair of her father and struggles with a mild temper. She has lighter
    skin than her father, dark red hair, and green eyes. She, much like her father, wears 
    loose leather clothes.
</p>

<h3>Urgg</h3>
<p>
    Urgg is the town blacksmith, owning and working the smithy with inhuman endurance. He
    is generally simple in his speech, but tries to be polite and keep his anger in check.
    If people get him to start complaining, it can take him hours to finally stop himself. 
</p>
<p>
    Urgg is no small orc, standing in at 6' 9" and bulging with scared muscle. Most of the
    scars are small burns and scratches. He has jet black hair, bright red eyes, and gray
    skin.
</p>
<p>
    Urgg normally wears yellow-green wool clothes and may wear a simple leather apron when
    working the forge.
</p>

<h3>Sven Tumisson</h3>
<p>
    Sven is a large, 6' 3" human with a build that would rival Marcus Fenix, bright blond
    hair, and deep blue eyes. He is generally cheery and good tempered, loving a joke that
    helps to lighten up the long day.
</p>
<p>
    Sven dresses in basic linens that are covered in dirt and ripped up.
</p>

<h3>Sabas of Arx</h3>
<p>
    Sabas is an old, and loyal, friend of Doris and the head guard of Ashborne. He is direct in how he
    interacts with people and has little patience for games. He is generally efficient at his job and
    does his best to keep the guards and malitia ready for any surprise orc attacks.
</p>
<p>
    Sabas is a 60 year old human with chocolate skin and muscles only beaten by the guns on Urgg.
    He has black hair and yellow eyes. He has a large scar that goes from his left jaw to his right
    ear.
</p>
<p>
    When on duty, Sabas wears bright white and gold full plate armor with the symbol of Durn on it. When
    off duty, he tends to wear simple earth toned linens and wools.
</p>

<h3>Asny Skorridottir</h3>
<p>
    Asny is a consistently tired female elven guard who is quickly annoyed by sexual advances. She
    tries to do her job as best as she can. She is very elegant and grace when she moves.
</p>
<p>
    Asny stands at 5 feet tall with pale skin, chocolate hair, and green and gold eyes. She keeps her
    hair short enough to easily fit under her helmet. 
</p>
<p>
    Ansy has been wooed by Aaron (Friendly). She is now pregnent with Aaron's children (identical
    triplets, 20 months, 1 trimester every 6 months, +3 con).
</p>

<h3>Skjold Hakisson</h3>
<p>
    The bitter old human wizard of Ashborne who specializes in divinition. He is distrusting of
    others. He seeks to find what the dragon Mirrit is trying to hide. He lives in a dirt tower
    on the outside of town.
</p>
<p>
    Skjold is 72 years old, and looks the part, with silver hair and hazy silvered eyes. Traces
    of gold can be seen if one looks close enough. He stands at 5' 6".
</p>

<h3>Bjor Hrappsson</h3>
<p>
    Bjor is the sterotypical jolly old clergyman. He is the pastor of Durn in Ashborne.
    He often works at the temple, not far from Doris. He is often quick to help guide
    the young elf in both spiritual and political matters. He does truly care for Doris
    and the people of Ashborne.
</p>
<p>
    Bjor is almost never found outside of his golden robes, which serve to accentuate the
    elderly gnome's aged features. His hair is the same deep purple as his eyes, but his 
    skin is surprisingly pale. Bjor is 187 years old and stands at 3' 5".
</p>
<h3>Father Rix</h3>
<p>
    Human father at the temple within Ashborne. Studies and archives events within the town.
</p>
<h3>Thyri Folkmardottir</h3>
<p>
    Thyri is the female wild elf that runs Copperback Supplies. She stands at 5' tall with
    a muscular body that has the beginnings of fat buildup. She has black hair and caramel
    skin and wears a grass and leaf bra (leaving her respectable bussoms on display) with
    a pair of pants made from deer hide.
</p>
<p>
    Thyri is not dumb, but is on the lower end of the intellectual norm. However, she is
    friendly and optimistic, often mistaking more aggressive gestures as being kinder than
    they actually are. She is also perceptive of her surroundings, and many a thief have
    failed thanks to her keen eyes.
</p>
<h2>Notable Places</h2>
<h3>Liquid Gold Tavern</h3>
<p>
    The friendliest tavern in town, run by the halfling Hagi Hagison and his family. It is
    a large, mainly wood building with a dining area, kitchen, bar, and 5 rentable rooms on
    the east wall.
</p>
<h3>Graystone Smithy</h3>
<p>
    Smithy owned by the orc Urgg. Has 5 seperate smithing stations, 1 of which is available
    for rent. Has a store which sells nails, horseshoes, beartraps, weapons and armor. Most
    of the smithy is below a tall stone ceiling that keeps the sunlight off of the smiths
    while still allowing the forges to spit smoke into the sky.
</p>
<h3>Copperback Supplies</h3>
<p>
    Copperback Supplies is a small adventurer store that buys and sells goods useful to
    adventurers, miners, and travellers, seeking to supply those going to the Copperback
    mountains or travelling out into the plains.
</p>
<p>
    The store is made up of a single, large wooden building with several racks and support
    beams covering the lower floor with supplies, with a small counter near the entrance.
    The second story, which is accessable by a set of stairs behind the counter, is the
    living space of the owner, Thyri Folkmardottir.
