<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Luta Dagdottir is a 5' 9" tall Lynian woman with short, wavy brown hair and brown eyes. She has palish
    flesh with no visible scars, however she does have a dark scar underneath her left breast and dwarven
    runes branded on her back (which make no sense). She is well endowed.
</p>
<p>
    Luta weighs 165 pounds, though she doesn't look it. She also has smooth, thin limbs that hide her great
    strength.
</p>
<ap-auth-container permissions="luta-rune luta-full aaron-full" style="font-style: italic;">
    <p>
        The rune on her back says "Property of Gurdath" in goblin.
    </p>
</ap-auth-container>
<p>
    When not in her armor, Luta likes to look pretty and will put on basic, homemade makeup. If she feels
    she can get away with it Luta will put on her yellow silk dress, with flowery satin corset, and jeweled
    necklace and rings. When she she can't get away with her nice dress, Luta will put on her sturdy leather
    dress and boots. 
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
    When fighting alone, Luta will usually stick to either using her bow to outrange an opponent and kill
    them before they get close, or she will try to get within melee range and engage them with both of her
    weapons.
</p>
<p>
    When fighting with a group, Luta tries to coordinate manuevers to get her around the enemies so that
    she can lay into them with her two weapons, striking at their weakest points. She does try to avoid
    fighting more than two enemies at once.
</p>

<h2>History and Motivation</h2>
<p>
    Luta was born in the small settlement of Cuul, where she was raised by her parents. On her 13th birthday,
    amidst her family's celebration, a party of hobgoblins attacked and killed her father. Luta, her mother,
    and her two younger brothers were taken as slaves by the hobgoblins. She would escape 4 years later and
    begin travelling in the hopes that she could gain what she needed to get payback.
</p>
<p>
    Luta seeks to maintain her freedom, take vengeance on her old master and to find her family, freeing them
    if she can.
</p>
<ap-auth-container permissions="luta-past luta-full aaron-full" style="font-style: italic;">
    <p>
        Luta was used for magical experiments by her old master, Gurdath. Gurdath is a hobgoblin wizard.
        He was trying to create warriors that would look unintimidating that could then use that to their
        advantage. This has no lasting magical auras on Luta.
    </p>
    <p>
        The experimentation has also left Luta more vulnerable to "training."
