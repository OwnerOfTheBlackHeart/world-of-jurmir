<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	Erik can be described as the quintessential human male: roughly 5' 9", 175 pounds, sandy blonde hair, slightly
	tanned skin, and average bulk. However, his mere presence is enough to make most people's skin crawl.
	His typical attire is a set of grey, soft cotton robes with a pair of leather boots and a belt with
	several pouches. When travelling, he dawns well worn heavy wool clothes with thick leather boots and
	his signiture belt. He may also have a backpack and a heavy leather cloak for bad weather.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
	In combat Erik will try to avoid being targetted as much as possible. He will make full use of his stealthy
	skills and his mysteries to ensure that he remains unseen as much as possible. If he is force to join in a
	normal fight, he will utalize his Arrow of Dusk and his Steel Shadows to allow himself protection and range,
	turning to his crossbow when his mysteries run out.
