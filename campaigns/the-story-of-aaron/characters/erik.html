	<i>Steal Spell (Su):</i>
	A spellthief can siphon spell energy away from his target and use it himself. A spellthief
	who hits an opponent with a successful sneak attack	can choose to forgo dealing 1d6 points
	of sneak attack	damage and instead steal a spell, or the potential to cast a specific known 
	spell, from his target. If the target is willing, a spellthief can steal a spell with a 
	touch as a standard action.
</p>
<p>
	The target of a steal spell attack loses one 0-level or	1st-level spell from memory if she 
	prepares spells ahead of time, or one 0-level or 1st-level spell slot if she is a spontaneous 
	caster. A spontaneous caster also loses the	ability to cast the stolen spell for 1 minute. 
	If the target has no spells prepared (or has no remaining spell slots, if she is a spontaneous
	caster), this ability has no effect. A spellthief can choose which spell to steal; otherwise, 
	the	DM determines the stolen spell randomly. If a spellthief tries to steal a spell that isn’t 
	available, the stolen spell (or	spell slot) is determined randomly from among those the
	target has available.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	Erik can be described as the quintessential human male: roughly 5' 9", 175 pounds, sandy blonde hair, slightly
	tanned skin, and average bulk. However, his mere presence is enough to make most people's skin crawl.
	His typical attire is a set of grey, soft cotton robes with a pair of leather boots and a belt with
	several pouches. When travelling, he dawns well worn heavy wool clothes with thick leather boots and
	his signiture belt. He may also have a backpack and a heavy leather cloak for bad weather.

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
	In combat Erik will try to avoid being targetted as much as possible. He will make full use of his stealthy
	skills and his mysteries to ensure that he remains unseen as much as possible. If he is force to join in a
	normal fight, he will utalize his Arrow of Dusk and his Steel Shadows to allow himself protection and range,
	turning to his crossbow when his mysteries run out.
