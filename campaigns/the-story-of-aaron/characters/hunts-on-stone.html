	<i>Hold Breath (Ex):</i>
	A lizardfolk can hold its breath for a number of rounds equal to four times its 
	Constitution score before it risks sufficating or drowning.
</p>

<p>
	<i>Wild Empathy (Ex):</i>
	A ranger can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve 
	the attitude of a person. The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma modifier to determine 
	the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild 
	animals are usually unfriendly.
</p>
<p>
	To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be 
	within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way 
	takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.
</p>
<p>
	The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he
	takes a -4 penalty on the check.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	Hunts on Stone is a 7' tall, 233 pound mass of stone grey scales with a white chest. Her eyes are 
	are a deep yellow. She has no visible scars.
</p>
<p>
	Hunts on Stone rarely wears anything other than a simple loin cloth.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
	Hunts on Stone generally rushes forward in a fight, relying on her harder than normal scales to
	protect her. If she knows that an opponent is stronger than her, she may use her javelins to
	attack from a distance or study her opponent further before attacking smarter.
</p>

<h2>History and Motivation</h2>
<p>
	Hunts on Stone was sent out of her tribe by the elder Speaks with Fury to track down and kill the
	cult that slew 6 of the members of her tribe. Hunts on Stone acknowledges the fact that she will 
	not be allowed to return to her tribe because of her time away from them.
