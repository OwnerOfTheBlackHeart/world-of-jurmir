<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	Hunts on Stone is a 7' tall, 233 pound mass of stone grey scales with a white chest. Her eyes are 
	are a deep yellow. She has no visible scars.
</p>
<p>
	Hunts on Stone rarely wears anything other than a simple loin cloth.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
	Hunts on Stone generally rushes forward in a fight, relying on her harder than normal scales to
	protect her. If she knows that an opponent is stronger than her, she may use her javelins to
	attack from a distance or study her opponent further before attacking smarter.
</p>

<h2>History and Motivation</h2>
<p>
	Hunts on Stone was sent out of her tribe by the elder Speaks with Fury to track down and kill the
	cult that slew 6 of the members of her tribe. Hunts on Stone acknowledges the fact that she will 
	not be allowed to return to her tribe because of her time away from them.
