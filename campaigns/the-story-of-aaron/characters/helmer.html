<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	If elves can be intimidating, then Helmer is the definition of what a physically intimidating elf looks like.
	He stands at an impressive 5' 4" with dense and visible muscle covering his lithe body, which weighs in at 151
	pounds. He has dark brown skin, dirt brown hair, and slitted yellow eyes. He has many scars across his body and
	two that form an X over the center of his face. Helmer also has scales from his hands to his elbows and from his
	feet to his knees.
</p>
<p>
	Helmer's typical attire is a shirt and skirt made from two seperate wolves that drapes over his shoulders and
	around his waste with rabbit fur shoes.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
	In combat, Helmer is generally as aggressive as possible. He prefers to get the enemy close enough to
	unleash his devistation fluries of attacks from his dual bladed sword.
</p>

<h2>History and Motivation</h2>
<p>
	Helmer is looking for any knowledge that could help him to combat the drow that plague his homeland.
	He also seeks to start an army/order dedicated to hunting down drow on the surface.
