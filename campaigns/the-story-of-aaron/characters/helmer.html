<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	If elves can be intimidating, then Helmer is the definition of what a physically intimidating elf looks like.
	He stands at an impressive 5' 4" with dense and visible muscle covering his lithe body, which weighs in at 151
	pounds. He has dark brown skin and dirt brown hair. He has many scars across his body and two that form an X
	over the center of his face.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
	In combat, Helmer is generally as aggressive as possible. He prefers to get the enemy close enough to
	unleash his devistation fluries of attacks from his dual bladed sword.
