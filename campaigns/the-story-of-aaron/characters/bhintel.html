<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Bhintel is 5' tall and 122 lbs with long pink hair, fiery red eyes, skin as black as night, and soft features.
    Bhintel wears a pale brown robes with several pockets and a backpack. When travelling about, he wears a chain
    shirt over top of the robes.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
    In combat, Bhintel does his best to maintain range, using his eldritch blast when he can and his crossbow when
    he can't. When forced to engage in melee, he prefers to focus his eldritch blast through his spear.
</p>

<h2>History and Motivation</h2>
<p>
    Bhintel came to the surface with the scouting party of House Duskryn in Arx with the intent of scouting for good
    locations to gather slaves. He will serve whoever is his acting mistress/master, but will continue to feed
    information to House Duskryn and try to advance drow operations on the surface.
</p>
<p>
	Bhintel wants to become female, and get boobs.
