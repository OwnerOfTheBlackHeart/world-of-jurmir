<p>
	<i><b>Powerful Build (Ex):</b></i>
    The physical stature of a goliath lets him function in many ways as if he were one size category larger. 
    Whenever a goliath is subject to a size modifier or special size modifier for an opposed check (such as
    during grapple checks, bull rush attempts, and trip attempts), the goliath is treated as one size larger 
    if doing so is advantageous to him. A goliath is also considered to be one size larger when determining 
    whether a creature’s special attacks based on size (such as improved grab or swallow whole) can affect 
    him. A goliath can use weapons designed for a creature one size larger without penalty. However, his space 
    and reach remain those of a creature of his actual size. The benefits of this racial trait stack with the 
    effects of powers, abilities, and spells that change the subject’s size category.
</p>

<p>
	<i><b>Mountain Movement (Ex):</b></i>
    Goliaths can make standing long jumps and high jumps as if they were running long jumps and high jumps. 
    A goliath can engage in accelerated climbing (climbing half his speed as a move action) without taking 
    the –5 penalty on the Climb check.
</p>

<p>
	<i><b>Acclimated (Ex):</b></i>
    Goliaths don’t take the penalties for altitude described in the Mountain Travel section on page 90 of the
    Dungeon Master’s Guide. Unlike other denizens of the mountains, goliaths don’t lose their acclimation to 
    high altitude even if they spend a long time at a lower elevation.
</p>

<p>
	<i><b>Shield Block (Ex):</b></i>
    During your action, designate a single opponent as the target of this ability. Your shield bonus to AC 
    against that foe increases by 1, as you move your shield to deflect an incoming blow, possibly providing 
    just enough protection to turn a telling swing into a knights near miss.
</p>

<p>
	<i><b>Knight's Challenge (3/3 per day, 6 rounds per use, DC 13) (Ex):</b></i>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <i>Fighting Challenge +1 (Ex):</i>
                As a swift action, you can issue a challenge against a single opponent. The target of this ability
                must have an Intelligence of 5 or higher, have a language of some sort, and have a CR greater than 
                or equal to your character level minus 2. If it does not meet these requirements, a use of this 
                ability is expended without effect.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the target does meet the conditions given above, you gain a +1 morale bonus on Will saves and a 
                +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against the target of this ability. You fight with 
                renewed vigor and energy by placing your honor and reputation on the line. If your chosen foe reduces 
                you to 0 or fewer hit points, you lose two uses of your knight’s challenge ability for the day because 
                of the blow to your ego and confidence from this defeat.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are capable of issuing a knight’s challenge more than once per day, you can use this ability 
                more than once in a single encounter. If your first chosen foe is defeated or flees the area, you 
                can issue a new challenge to a different foe. You cannot switch foes if your original target is still 
                active.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <i>Test of Mettle (Ex):</i>
                Starting at 4th level, you can shout a challenge to all enemies, calling out for the mightiest among
                them to face you in combat. Any target of this ability must have a language of some sort and an 
                Intelligence score of 5 or higher. Creatures that do not meet these requirements are immune to the 
                test of mettle. You must have line of sight and line of effect to the targets of this ability.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a swift action, you can expend one use of your knight’s challenge ability to cause all your enemies 
                within 100 feet with a CR greater than or equal to your character level minus 2 to make Will saves 
                (Knight's Challenge DC). Creatures that fail this save are forced to attack you with their ranged or melee 
                attacks in preference over other available targets. If a foe attacks by casting a spell or using a supernatural 
                ability, he must target you with the attack or include you in the effect’s area.
            </p>
            <p>
                An opponent compelled to act in this manner is not thrown into a mindless rage and does not have to move to 
                attack you in melee if doing so would provoke attacks of opportunity against him. In such a case, he can use 
                ranged attacks against you or attack any opponents he threatens as normal. If anyone other than you attacks 
                the target, the effect of the test of mettle ends for that specific target.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by an opponent forced to attack you due to this ability, you gain one
                additional use of your knight’s challenge ability for that day. This additional use comes from increased confidence
                and the knowledge that you have proved your mettle as a knight against your enemies by calling out foes even against
                overwhelming odds. This additional use disappears if you have not used it by the start of the next day. You can only
                gain one additional use of your knight’s challenge ability in this manner per day.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    <i><b>Bulwark of Defense (Ex):</b></i>
    When you reach 3rd level, an opponent that begins its turn in your threatened area treats all the squares 
    that you threaten as difficult terrain. Your strict vigilance and active defensive maneuvers force your
    opponents to move with care.
</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Paavu stands at 7' 11" and weighs in at 326 lbs. Her skin is the typical goliath gray with both lithoderms
    and tattoos of her battles she has had since leaving her tribe. She keeps her dull black hair in a long braid
    that goes down to her lower back. She has emerald eyes.
</p>
<p>
    If Paavu is wearing clothes, she is wearing her armor. Her armor does leave her arms exposed, so that she can
    show off her arms and the tattoos on them.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
    Paavu, while strong and capable of dealing significant damage, is not particularly tactical. She will generally
    find the mightiest target and attempt to draw the creature’s attention to her 
</p>

<h2>History and Motivation</h2>
<p>
    Paavu earned the name Flesheater when she ate an orc, that she had killed with a hunting party of her clan, raw.
    After seeing the horror, her huntmates went to the chieftain and told him of the event. This not only granted
    Paavu her middle name, but also her exile.
</p>
<p>
    Paavu fights for food or challenge, often both. She seeks to further challenge herself and to taste new types of
    flesh.
