	<i class="power">Stored Spell:</i> Hold Person (DC 15)
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Poison Use:</i> Due to their long tradition of working with
    venoms, poison dusks are never at risk when applying poisons
    to weapons. Common poisons include black adder venom
    and blue whinnis.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Chameleon Skin (Ex):</i> Poison dusks can adjust the
    colors of their scales to blend in with their surroundings.
    When it is not wearing armor, robes or other covering
    clothing, a poison dusk lizardfolk gains a +5 racial bonus
    on Hide checks.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Trapfinding:</i>
    Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Search skill to locate traps when the task has a Difficulty Class higher than 20.
</p>
<p>
    Finding a nonmagical trap has a DC of at least 20, or higher if it is well hidden. Finding a magic trap has a DC of 25 
    + the level of the spell used to create it.
</p>
<p>
    Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Disable Device skill to disarm magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 
    + the level of the spell used to create it.
</p>
<p>
    A rogue who beats a trapâ€™s DC by 10 or more with a Disable Device check can study a trap, figure out how it works, and 
    bypass it (with her party) without disarming it.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Evasion (Ex):</i>
    At 2nd level and higher, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful 
    Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. 
    Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of 
    evasion.
    
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Trap Sense (Ex):</i>
    At 3rd level, a rogue gains an intuitive sense that alerts her to danger from traps, giving her a +1 bonus on Reflex saves 
    made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps.
</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Rass is a 4' 5" tall, 67 pound lizardfolk covered in fur which changes color to match the environment.
    She has large, yellow eyes and a tail that is 1' 4". Her muzzle is shorter than would be expected for
    her size and her teeth point in different directions.
</p>
<p>
    Unlike her people, Rass prefers to wear armor when she can. When not in armor, Rass doesn't even bother
    to wear a loin cloth, except in cold weather.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
    Rass prefers to not attack an enemy unless she has the advantage. When she can she will use her ability
    to hide and move quietly to catch lone enemies and eleminate them before they can be a problem. When fighting
    with allies, she will engage enemies from a distance, only entering into the melee when she can get around
    an enemy and strike at their weak points.
</p>

<h2 id="history-and-motivation">History and Motivation</h2>
<p>
    Rass was the unfortunate creation of a gnoll raid that left survivors. She lived among poison dusk lizardfolk
    until the gnolls came back and killed the rest of her clan. Since then she has been walking among the
    mammal races.
</p>
<p>
    As a rather monsterious half-mammal, Rass has had trouble finding a place in the society of mammals and seeks
    to find a tribe that will let her in, whatever they may be.
</p>
<p>
	During one of her first meetings with Aaron, Aaron began sexually training her to be his pet. So far, she has
	been receptive of the training.
