<p>
    <i>Arcane Attunement (Sp, 7/7):</i> 
    You can use the spell-like
    powers dancing lights, detect magic, flare, ghost sound, and read
    magic a combined total of times per day equal to 3 + your Int
    modifier. These spell-like powers do not count against your
	total of spells known or spells per day.
</p>

<p>
    <i>Armored Mage (Ex, Medium):</i>
    Normally, armor of any type interferes
    with an arcane spellcaster’s gestures, which can cause
    spells to fail if those spells have a somatic component. A
    duskblade’s limited focus and specialized training, however,
    allows you to avoid arcane spell failure so long as you stick
    to light armor and light shields. This training does not
    extend to medium or heavy armors, nor to heavy shields.
    This ability does not apply to spells gained from a different
	spellcasting class.
</p>

<p>
    <i>Arcane Channeling (Su):</i>
    Beginning at 3rd level, you can use a standard action to cast
    any touch spell you know and deliver the spell through your
    weapon with a melee attack. Casting a spell in this manner
    does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The spell must
    have a casting time of 1 standard action or less. If the melee
    attack is successful, the attack deals damage normally; then
    the effect of the spell is resolved.

	large scar just in front of her left ear. She has two 3 inch, black horns that protrude from just
	under her hairline and a whip-like tail.
</p>
<p>

</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
	In combat Chione prefers to engage in melees, using spells to enhance her hammer
	to turn her foes into paste. If she is caught with need of ranged combat, she
	will do so.<br/>

	When she has a round or two to prep, she will use bloody blade.
</p>
<h2>History and Motivation</h2>
<p>
	Chione was born in the town of Ashborne, left her parents at the age of 10, and learned how to be
	a duskblade from experience and a dusty old tome she found in the local library.
</p>
<p>
	Chione is motivated primarily by acquiring the power to get out of the life of petty jobs that
	has been sustaining her so far. She is interested in expanding her knowledge of magic, skill in
	combat, and political power.
</p>
<p>
	Has the spine dog, which grants her 1 gestaulted leve of fighter.
