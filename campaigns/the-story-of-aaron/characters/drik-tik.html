<p>
    <i>Rage (Ex):</i>
    A barbarian can fly into a rage a certain number of times per day. In a rage, a barbarian temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength, 
    a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but he takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase in 
    Constitution increases the barbarian’s hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the rage when 
    his Constitution score drops back to normal. (These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are.) While 
    raging, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except for Balance, Escape Artist, Intimidate, 
    and Ride), the Concentration skill, or any abilities that require patience or concentration, nor can he cast spells or activate magic 
    items that require a command word, a spell trigger (such as a wand), or spell completion (such as a scroll) to function. He can use 
    any feat he has except Combat Expertise, item creation feats, and metamagic feats. A fit of rage lasts for a number of rounds equal 
    to 3 + the character’s (newly improved) Constitution modifier. A barbarian may prematurely end his rage. At the end of the rage, the 
    barbarian loses the rage modifiers and restrictions and becomes fatigued (-2 penalty to Strength, -2 penalty to Dexterity, can’t charge 
    or run) for the duration of the current encounter (unless he is a 17th-level barbarian, at which point this limitation no longer applies).
</p>

<p>
    <i>Uncanny Dodge (Ex):</i>
    A barbarian retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if he is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, 
    he still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Drik-Tik stands at 5' 1" with a thick, sandy yellow exoskeleton, granting a weight of 156 lbs. One of
    her antenna is limp half-way up it and her exoskeleton has many marks where it has clearly healed over.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
    Drik-Tik prefers to make sure that she has at least her pounce mutation prepared. If she does, she will
    usually leap into battle and try to get as many strikes in as possible. If she has her fast healing mutation
    active, she will try and draw attention to her and absorb the damage while her allies flank and destroy her
    enemies. If she knows that she will be expected to stand and fight, she will ready her class with oversized
    offense while ensuring that she has at least fast healing 1.
</p>
<h2>History and Motivation</h2>
<p>
    Drik-Tik had a clan once. Then they died and she survived, only serving to prove that she was a better hunter
    than her clan. She then suffered through life on her own for a while before coming upon civilization. Civilization
    that she quickly grew to view as weak, but whose numbers prevented her from being able to do anything about.
</p>
<p>
    Now Drik-Tik seeks to grow in power and to acquire a new clan. A strong clan. A clan that can exert influence
    over the weaker creatures that surround her.
