<h1>Session Logs</h1>
<h2>First Session</h2>
<p>
    Aaron the Aasimar Bard travelled from his small home throp of less than 80 people to travel to the town of Ashborne,
    following a rumor that a wizard by the name of Skjold Hakisson, who specializes in divination, lives in a tower at
    the outside of town.
</p>
<p>
    After the description of Ashborne, Aaron chose to begin in the Liquid Gold tavern asking Hagi Hagison for temporary
    employment. After the halfling told Aaron that his family has the bar covered, he pointed out the empty stage that
    Aaron could play at. He did and rolled a 32 (natural 20 with a masterwork instrument).
</p>
<p>
    During his awesome jam session, which netted Aaron some more food, booze, gold, and a place to stay the night, he
    saw a female tiefling (Chione) shake a patron of the tavern down and witnessed the most average man with a strange
    aura about him. Aaron failed to notice what made the man seem so strange.
</p>
<h2>Second Session</h2>
<p>
    As a new day rises, Aaron once again plays at the Liquid Gold tavern, with a slightly weaker performance. He goes
    and attempts to speak with Skjold, only serving to anger the old wizard. He returns to the bar as the day comes to
    a close, and decides to talk to the scary tiefling, whom he learned is named Chione when he opened
    a good rapport with her (the booze didn't hurt).
</p>
<p>
    Aaron then drunkely went to torture Skjold as the guard Asny approached. While she is not normally welcoming of
    advances (thanks to the sheer number of them), Aaron's pure charm won her over (friendly). She is now slightly
    smitten with Aaron and has revealed to him the times she is available in the bar. He impregnated her.
</p>
<p>
    On the third day, Aaron talked to Erik. Convinced him that joining the group would be a good idea, but he needs
    to see more people invested. Aaron also managed to seduce Chione and impregnate her (9 months, 3 month trimesters).
</p>
<h2>Third Session</h2>
<p>
    Aaron had a poor night of song. He headed to the temple/townhall. Talked with Lord Sabas of Arx and revealed that
    Aaron is from Pike (throp, 40 people). Was informed about a wild elf in Ashborne (Helmer) and that gate guards
    tend to know who is coming in and out. Finds Ansy at the Liquid Gold and learns of the general location of Helmer
    as well as rumors of a lizardfolk outside of town (Hunts on Stone). He also managed to bed Ansy a second time.
</p>
<p>
    The fourth day begins. Fought some drow with Helmer and won some nice stuff. Took the goods and played a prank on
    Chione. Informed Ansy of the drow confrontation. Bought Helmer a room.
</p>
<p>
    Aaron sleeps until the day. Sells stuff, including poison. Runs into Hunts on Stone and recruits her. Officially 
    forms party and plans on going to the ruins of the old school in the grasslands. Purchases a mule and 2 donkeys
    and a animal handler for 2 gp. Sold scroll to Skjold.
</p>
<h2>Fourth Session</h2>
<p>
    Travelled to the school without issue. Fought several of the wild elves and talked down the small clan (5 days). 
    They will stay for a short while and then leave. Found the spellbook in the containment room. Managed to take over
    the ruins of the school. Spend 1 day studing at the library of the ruined school. Leaving Erik behind when
    travelling to Arx.
