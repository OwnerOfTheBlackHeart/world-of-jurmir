<h1>Session Logs</h1>
<h2>First Session</h2>
<p>
    Aaron the Aasimar Bard travelled from his small home Thorp of less than 80 people to travel to the town of Ashborne,
    following a rumor that a wizard by the name of Skjold Hakisson, who specializes in divination, lives in a tower at
    the outside of town.
</p>
<p>
    After the description of Ashborne, Aaron chose to begin in the Liquid Gold tavern asking Hagi Hagison for temporary
    employment. After the halfling told Aaron that his family has the bar covered, he pointed out the empty stage that
    Aaron could play at. He did and rolled a 32 (natural 20 with a masterwork instrument).
</p>
<p>
    During his awesome jam session, which netted Aaron some more food, booze, gold, and a place to stay the night, he
    saw a female tiefling (Chione) shake a patron of the tavern down and witnessed the most average man with a strange
    aura about him. Aaron failed to notice what made the man seem so strange.
</p>
<h2>Second Session</h2>
<p>
    As a new day rises, Aaron once again plays at the Liquid Gold tavern, with a slightly weaker performance. He goes
    and attempts to speak with Skjold, only serving to anger the old wizard. He returns to the bar as the day comes to
    a close, and decides to talk to the scary tiefling, whom he learned is named Chione when he opened
    a good rapport with her (the booze didn't hurt).
</p>
<p>
    Aaron then drunkely went to torture Skjold as the guard Asny approached. While she is not normally welcoming of
    advances (thanks to the sheer number of them), Aaron's pure charm won her over (friendly). She is now slightly
    smitten with Aaron and has revealed to him the times she is available in the bar. He impregnated her.
</p>
<p>
    On the third day, Aaron talked to Erik. Convinced him that joining the group would be a good idea, but he needs
    to see more people invested. Aaron also managed to seduce Chione and impregnate her (9 months, 3 month trimesters).
</p>
<h2>Third Session</h2>
<p>
    Aaron had a poor night of song. He headed to the temple/townhall. Talked with Lord Sabas of Arx and revealed that
    Aaron is from Pike (Thorp, 40 people). Was informed about a wild elf in Ashborne (Helmer) and that gate guards
    tend to know who is coming in and out. Finds Ansy at the Liquid Gold and learns of the general location of Helmer
    as well as rumors of a lizardfolk outside of town (Hunts on Stone). He also managed to bed Ansy a second time.
</p>
<p>
    The fourth day begins. Fought some drow with Helmer and won some nice stuff. Took the goods and played a prank on
    Chione. Informed Ansy of the drow confrontation. Bought Helmer a room.
</p>
<p>
    Aaron sleeps until the day. Sells stuff, including poison. Runs into Hunts on Stone and recruits her. Officially 
    forms party and plans on going to the ruins of the old school in the grasslands. Purchases a mule and 2 donkeys
    and a animal handler for 2 gp. Sold scroll to Skjold.
</p>
<h2>Fourth Session</h2>
<p>
    Travelled to the school without issue. Fought several of the wild elves and talked down the small clan (5 days). 
    They will stay for a short while and then leave. Found the spellbook in the containment room. Managed to take over
    the ruins of the school. Spend 1 day studing at the library of the ruined school. Leaving Erik behind when
    travelling to Arx.
</p>
<h2>Fifth Session</h2>
<p>
    Aaron and Chione went back into the basement of the complex now known as Oasis. Aaron chose the imp, granting him
    wizardly powers. Chione the spine dog, improving her martial might. Erik the skeletal satyr, granting him divination.
    In Arx, Aaron sold art and gems to nobles while playing an extrodinary (33) performance. He sells most of his loot and
    gets on good terms with most of the shopkeeps.
</p>
<p>
    Back at Oasis, Erik used stealth and tactics to successfuly kill a gnollish hunting party of 5 gnolls and 2 hyenas...
    alone.
</p>
<p>
    Showed Hunts the mamamilian sex organs and had sex with Ingirun Thorlakdottir, ending the day. Began training Chione 
    to obey (1 success). Aaron impregnated Ingirun. Ended the session entering the sewers.
</p>
<h2>Sixth Session</h2>
<p>
    Went into the sewers. Meet Paavu and cleared out a goblin nest, but took some decent damage doing so. Paavu lead to
    the Gagged Harpy. Aaron bought a virgin halfling who failed to please Paavu, which was then eaten eaten by Paavu.
</p>
<p>
    Chione and Hunts went to the library in Arx and Chione discovered several locations (20 on the roll) that could hold 
    the cult that Hunts and her are looking for. They found that it was the Cult of the Red King that Hunts is after.
</p>
<p>
    New day rises. Party goes to hunt drow with Paavu in the lead. They found a drow encampment and attacked. Captured a
    male and female drow (chosen of Sithrak). Aaron attempted to brainwash Chione and the female drow (22, fail on Chione,
    pass on the drowess).
</p>
<p>
    New day rises. As everyone wakes up, Aaron attempts more brainwashing with the female drow (31, 2nd success). They
    sell the loot for the last two days adventures.
</p>
<h2>Seventh Session</h2>
<p>
    Aaron goes to the castle within Arx. He convinces the drowess to obey and remain hidden until she is shown off. He 
    plays his lyre as he approaches the gate guards (34). He sought Theas, Herald of Feph for information on whether
    Zita can be met in private, or not. He plays a song of Feph for the priest on approach (21). He learned that she has
    fewer nobles around during lunch/noon and that she may occasionally meet privately, but only when she initiates it.
</p>
<p>
    Aaron presents his guild idea to Zita and gets approval. He shows off his control of the party, which she apprechates.
    Met and recruited Rass as well as purchasing Chione a fremale drow slave. Aaron helps Chione train her slave (20, 1st
    success, 4' 8", 95 lbs). Aaron then fucks Rass and starts to brainwash her (37, 1st and 2nd succes). Had orgy on way 
    out of Arx.
</p>
<p>
    Travelled to the Oasis. Introduced everyone to Erik (after Erik fought off a small goblin scouting party). Trained 
    Chione (32 and 29, 1st and 2nd succes, to be overly attached). Aaron gives his ass to Chione.
</p>
<h2>Eighth Session</h2>
<p>
    Aaron leaves the Oasis planning to hunt down a nearby druid, but ends up sidetracked as the imp and spikedog lay simple
    quests upon Aaron and Chione. The party then goes to 2 small settlements on the river near the Oasis, completing Chione's
    quest to kill a priest upon an altar as well as recruiting Signy Validottir to serve as the wetnurse at Oasis.
</p>
<h2>Ninth Session</h2>
<p>
    Aaron returns to Ashborn hunting Signy's runaway lover, Tjorvi Dansson. He spends his first night in Ashborne preforming
    at the Liquid Gold (25) and heads out afterwards to find Ansy. He preforms the same trick (34) that won Ansy over the first
    time.
</p>
<p>
    Aaron and Chione manage to convince Tjorvi to get "one last good fuck" before he leaves town. They kidnap and kill Tjorvi
    by having Chione pose as a whore. They then captured him and took him out into the wilds, where Chione and Paavu had their
    way with him.
</p>
<p>
    The party then returned to the Oasis, where Aaron spent time working on transfering spells from the captured spellbook into
    his own. Travelled into the mountians south of the Oasis to find a druid, where they fought a wyvern, collecting its parts
    for later use. The party recruits the druids by dealing with an intelligent megaraptor.
</p>
<p>
    Cody then went to Arx and sold the loot, giving Rass a nice sword. He then gave a gold carving of the Table of the Gods
    painting to Zita, Speaker of Durn, for browny points. Chione also had wyvernhide armor and wyvernbone weapons made for
    her.
</p>
<h2>Tenth Session</h2>
<p>
    Did a fuck load of guild missions while waiting for Chione to give birth. She and Signy gave birth.
</p>
<h2>Eleventh Session</h2>
<p>
    After Hunts gave Aaron a mysterious book of letters written in voidspeak, he had Erik translate and then went to Arx...
    Aaron went to court and agreed to have Oasis used as a rendezvous point for the assault force to attack Mordain as well 
    as serving as a base of operations for scouts and patrols of the pass between Lyrna and Cestrad. He also agreed to scout
    the pass to Cestrad when he returns from Seablood.
</p>
<p>
    Went into Seablood and got permits for the use of magic as well as a bounty for 100gp per head of a confirmed Red King
    Cultist. Aaron leaves the castle.
</p>
<h2>Twelfth Session</h2>
<p>
    Got abducted by the Red King cult and fuck the abductor (impregnating her) and then went searching for clues. During the
    search Aaron impregnated Nell Glasse of Seablood (with triplets, 20 on inseminate and acceptance rolls) and invited her to
    join him at the Oasis fortress. Aaron would follow her advice and purchase a pair of goggles of detect alignment and captured
    a cultist.
</p>
<p>
    After a very sexual interrogation, Aaron learned the location of the local Cult of the Red King base and made it to the
    entrance.
</p>
<h1>Thirteenth Session</h1>
<p>
    Aaron and his party go and equip themselves for the fight with Jennlinn, but Aaron purposefully wastes the day, sending
    Rass and 100 platinum coins to contract a wizard to create a seeking letter. Aaron took out the cult base, saving as many
    people as he could. Placed Jennlinn in charge, disguised as Dinzar.
