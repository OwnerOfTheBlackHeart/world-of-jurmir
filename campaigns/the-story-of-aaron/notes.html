<h1>Session Logs</h1>
<h2>First Session</h2>
<p>
    Aaron the Aasimar Bard travelled from his small home throp of less than 80 people to travel to the town of Ashborne,
    following a rumor that a wizard by the name of Skjold Hakisson, who specializes in divination, lives in a tower at
    the outside of town.
</p>
<p>
    After the description of Ashborne, Aaron chose to begin in the Liquid Gold tavern asking Hagi Hagison for temporary
    employment. After the halfling told Aaron that his family has the bar covered, he pointed out the empty stage that
    Aaron could play at. He did and rolled a 32 (natural 20 with a masterwork instrument).
</p>
<p>
    During his awesome jam session, which netted Aaron some more food, booze, gold, and a place to stay the night, he
    saw a female tiefling (Chione) shake a patron of the tavern down and witnessed the most average man with a strange
    aura about him. Aaron failed to notice what made the man seem so strange.
