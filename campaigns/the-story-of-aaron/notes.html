<h1>Session Logs</h1>
<h2>First Session</h2>
<p>
    Aaron the Aasimar Bard travelled from his small home throp of less than 80 people to travel to the town of Ashborne,
    following a rumor that a wizard by the name of Skjold Hakisson, who specializes in divination, lives in a tower at
    the outside of town.
</p>
<p>
    After the description of Ashborne, Aaron chose to begin in the Liquid Gold tavern asking Hagi Hagison for temporary
    employment. After the halfling told Aaron that his family has the bar covered, he pointed out the empty stage that
    Aaron could play at. He did and rolled a 32 (natural 20 with a masterwork instrument).
</p>
<p>
    During his awesome jam session, which netted Aaron some more food, booze, gold, and a place to stay the night, he
    saw a female tiefling (Chione) shake a patron of the tavern down and witnessed the most average man with a strange
    aura about him. Aaron failed to notice what made the man seem so strange.
</p>
<h2>Second Session</h2>
<p>
    As a new day rises, Aaron once again plays at the Liquid Gold tavern, with a slightly weaker performance. He goes
    and attempts to speak with Skjold, only serving to anger the old wizard. He returns to the bar as the day comes to
    a close, and decides to talk to the scary tiefling, whom he learned is named Chione when he opened
    a good rapport with her (the booze didn't hurt).
</p>
<p>
    Aaron then drunkely went to torture Skjold as the guard Asny approached. While she is not normally welcoming of
    advances (thanks to the sheer number of them), Aaron's pure charm won her over (friendly). She is now slightly
    smitten with Aaron and has revealed to him the times she is available in the bar. He impregnated her.
</p>
<p>
    On the third day, Aaron talked to Erik. Convinced him that joining the group would be a good idea, but he needs
    to see more people invested. Aaron also managed to seduce Chione and impregnate her (9 months, 3 month trimesters).
