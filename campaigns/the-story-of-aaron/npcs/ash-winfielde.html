<h1>Ash Wineielde, Captured Cult Abductor</h1>
<p>
    Ash also appears in the <ap-link-button linkName="aaron-guild-members">Guild Member</ap-link-button>.
    Until she reaches level 6, she uses the statistics of a <ap-link-button linkName="red-king-abductor">
    Red King Cult Abductor</ap-link-button>.

<p>
    Ash is a human female with white-brown hair (similar in color to the wood of white ash trees), near-red
    amber eyes, and pale skin. She has a svelte figure, standing at 5' 6" and weighing only 111lbs (when not
    carrying a child). Ash prefers to wear her old cult armor when adventuring and will typically wear red or
    white dresses when not in armor.

<p>
    Ash doesn't like direct sunlight, do to her being near albino. She does, however, take a 10% reduction to
    miss chances from concealment by darkness and reduces any penalties to spot checks from darkness by 2.

<p>
    Ash is pregnant with Aaron's children. They will be born on Durnio 6th, 1489, but there will be complications
    as she rolled a natural 1 on her acceptance roll.
