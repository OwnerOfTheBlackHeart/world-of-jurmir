	<i power="power">Bane:</i>
	Dinzar's bardiche (mechanically a halberd) has bane outsider (evil) on it. Against an evil outsider, the bardiche
	counts as having a +4 enhancement bonus and 2d6 extra damage.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Domain Power (Strength):</i>
    You can perform a feat of strength as a supernatural ability. You gain an enhancement bonus to Strength equal to 
    your cleric level. Activating the power is a free action, the power lasts 1 round, and it is usable once per day.
</p>
<p>
    <i class="power">Domain Power (Death):</i>
	You may use a death touch once per day. Your death touch is a supernatural ability that produces a death effect. 
	You must succeed on a melee touch attack against a living creature (using the rules for touch spells). When you touch, 
	roll 1d6 per cleric level you possess. If the total at least equals the creature’s current hit points, it dies (no save).
</p>

<p>
	<i class="power">Judgement (Su):</i>
	A cleric of Sithrak can, as a swift action, declare that they are judging a creature. When a cleric of Sithrak is
	judging a creature, all attacks made against the creature by the cleric count as lawful, good, and evil. A cleric of
	Sithrak can only judge one creature at a time and a judgement can only be removed from a creature by the death of the
	creature or by breaking line of sight with the cleric of Sithrak for 1 minute.

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
	This droll stands at roughly 7 feet tall and has an imposing musculature. He is covered with black fur, except on his main
	and chest which are both bone white. Across his body, Dinzar is covered in countless scars, many hidden beneath his fur, with
	a notable scar on the right side of his muzzle, just in front of his eye. He wears a piecemeal and heavy looking breastplate,
	the metal of which seems to be abnormally dark.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
	Dinzar is a true Judge, running into combat and choosing a single opponent to pass his judgement upon. While doing so, he uses
	his spells to make himself even stronger in fighting his enemy, and buffing his allies when he deems it useful.
