<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    White Skull stands at 6' 8" and has a strong build, even for a gnoll. When not wearing his armor, the gnollish rune for
    exile is clearly visible on his chest. When he is wearing his chainshirt, the same rune is painted on the front.
    White Skull dies the top of his skull white.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
    White Skull tends to rush at his opponents, tring to close the gap and get within range to begin destroying them with
    strike after strike after strike from Warmnight and Lawbringer. If getting within range is unreasonable, White Skull
    will utalize his bow to whittle away at his targets from a distance. When he can, White Skull with flank or suprise
    oppenents, making full use of his sneak attack ability.
</p>

<h2>History and Motivation</h2>
<p>
    At one point White Skull was just another gnoll, but one day he thought that if slaves were slightly better fed and
    cared for, they could learn more of what they are doing and become more valuable slaves. He eventually got into a
    fight with another gnoll over this issue and killed the other gnoll and attempted to take the slave and prove his
    point. However, the other gnolls of his clan found out quickly and exiled him, branding his chest with the symbol of
    exile.
</p>
<p>
    After his exile, White Skull travelled, joining various adventuring parties and growing both in skill and in knowledge
    of civilization. Over this time White Skull came to believe that taking on the traits of civilization (written laws,
    building cities, ecouraging trade and farming) would benefit the gnolls, especially if most of the labor was done with
    slaves.
</p>
<p>
    White Skull now returns to his people in the hopes that he can show them what slave built cities, experienced slaves,
    and good trade has to offer them.
