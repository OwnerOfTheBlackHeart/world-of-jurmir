<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    A male elf stands ready to fight, but looking around. He is short and thin, even for an elf.
    He has charcoal black skin, silver hair, and vibrant red eyes that look about with malicious intent.
    He draws two swords as he looks at his target.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
    An urban drow does not strike unless he has the advantage. He is patient and willing to wait out targets
    in order to get the perfect strike. However, he may choose to use his personallity and deceptiveness to get
    his target to present the openning that he is looking for.
</p>
<p>
    Urban drow may become more brash and aggressive when they can easily get around a target, using numbers to
    create opportunities for deadly strikes. They may also become more aggressive when in the presence of a
    drow priestess or other authority figure.
