<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	Gnolls are hyena-headed, evil humanoids that wander in loose tribes. Most gnolls have dirty yellow or reddish-brown fur. 
	A gnoll is a nocturnal carnivore, preferring intelligent creatures for food because they scream more. A gnoll is about 
	7&frac12; feet tall and weighs 300 pounds. Gnolls speak Gnoll.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
	Gnolls like to attack when they have the advantage of numbers, using horde tactics and their physical strength to overwhelm 
	and knock down their opponents. They show little discipline when fighting unless they have a strong leader; at such times, 
	they can maintain ranks and fight as a unit. While they do not usually prepare traps, they do use ambushes and try to attack 
	from a <a href="/srd/combat/combatModifiers.htm#flanking">flanking</a> position.
