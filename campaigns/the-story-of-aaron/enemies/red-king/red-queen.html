<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Every red queen is different, but the most common are 9 foot tall beautiful women with gray skin and hair, red eyes, and tattered red 
    bat wings. Red queens travel as often alone (usually to find a place to create a cult following) as serving as a general to the armies
    of the Red King. Red queens personalities are also as variable as a humans, but they are always confident and loyal to the Red King.
</p>
<p>
	Every red queen was once a red princess who either gave birth to a pophagite, another powerful monstrosity, or distinguished herself on 
	the battlefield in such a manner as to capture the attention of the Red King. Being that giving birth to a pophagite is the most common
	option, it leads to the commonness of pale skin and tattered bat wings in red queens. Most red queens also possess flight, as is listed 
	in the stat block above.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
    Most red queens prefer to be at the front of a fight, whether as a leader or as a lone fighter. While they often use their spells to
    gain the advantage, red queens gain great pleasure from killing the enemies of the Red King with their +3 greatswords. They particularly
    enjoy slaying angels and dragons. Red queens will prioritize the lives of women of the Red King (queen, princess, and lady) over any 
    creature that isn't themselves.
