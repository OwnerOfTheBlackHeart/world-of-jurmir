<p>
    <i class="power">Weapon Alignment:</i>
    Jennlinn’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons she wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the 
    purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Energy Drain (Su):</i>
    Jennlinn drains energy from a mortal she lures into some act of passion, or by simply planting a kiss on the victim. 
    If the target is not willing to be kissed, Jennlinn must start a grapple, which provokes an attack of opportunity. 
    Jennlinn’s kiss or embrace bestows one negative level. The kiss also has the effect of a suggestion spell, asking 
    the victim to accept another kiss from Jennlinn. The victim must succeed on a DC 21 Will save to negate the effect 
    of the suggestion. The DC is 21 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. These save DCs are Charisma-based.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Heat (Ex):</i>
    Jennlinn generates so much heat that its mere touch deals additional fire damage. Jennlinn's metallic weapons also 
    conduct this heat. Jennlinn can activate and deactivate this power as a standard action.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Spell-like abilities:</i>
    At will — <i>charm monster (DC 22), detect good, flaming sphere (DC 20), ethereal jaunt (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), 
    produce flame, greater teleport (self plus 50 pounds of objects only)</i>. 3/day - <i>fireball (DC 21)</i>. Caster level 12th. 
    The save DCs are Charisma-based.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Summon Child (Sp):</i>
    Once per day Jennlinn can attempt to summon her child with a 50% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of 
    a 3rd-level spell.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Change Shape (Su):</i>
    An Jennlinn can assume the form of any Small or Medium humanoid.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Tongues (Su):</i>
    A Jennlinn has a permanent tongues ability (as the spell, caster level 12th). Jennlinn usually use verbal communication 
    with mortals.

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Jennlinn was once an ugly dwarfess who was captured by the Cult of the Red King in Seablood. After several days of
    "conditioning," she was taken down to the Void to be presented to the Red King. She was, at first, resistant to the 
    demands of the Red King until he made her an offer. He would make her beautiful, so beautiful that if she didn't like 
    the way she looked, she could change she. In exchange, she would bear him a child and serve him for the rest of her
    life. Jennlinn accepted almost without hesitation. 
</p>
<p>
    Jennlinn would give birth to <ap-link-button linkName="dhako-smogfang">Dhako Smogfand</ap-link-button>, a draconic, 
    alu-demon salamander. She bares the same warmth (at will) as her child as well as a similarly scaly hide.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
    Jennlinn is not a warrior. She flees combat whenever she can. If forced to fight, she will first try to turn her enemies
    against each other. However, if that doesn't appear to be an option, she will try to use her magic to defend herself from
    a distance while sending minions out to fight the enemy and possibly calling on <ap-link-button linkName="dhako-smogfang">
    Dhako</ap-link-button> if the situation seems dire enough. Jennlinn is not above changing her appearance to confuse her 
    enemies or disguise herself as a damsel in distress.
