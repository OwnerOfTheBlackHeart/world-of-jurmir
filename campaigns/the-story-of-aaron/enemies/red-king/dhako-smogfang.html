<p>
    <i class="power">Weapon Alignment:</i>
    Dhako's natural weapons, as well as any weapons he wields, are treated as magic and evil-aligned for the 
    purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Constrict (Ex):</i>
    Dhako deals automatic tail slap damage (including fire damage) with a successful grapple check.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Heat (Ex):</i>
    Dhako generates so much heat that its mere touch deals additional fire damage. Dhako's metallic weapons also 
    conduct this heat.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Improved Grab (Ex):</i>
    To use this ability, Dhako must hit a creature of up to one size larger than himself with its tail slap 
    attack. He can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If 
    he wins the grapple check, he establishes a hold and can constrict.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Draining Touch (Su):</i>
    Dhako can make a Touch Attack that does 1d6 + 5 (Charisma modifier) Negative Energy damage, which heals the Dhako 
    half of the damage. Usable once per round.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Spell-like abilities:</i>
    3/day - <i>charm person (DC 16), detect thoughts (DC 17), suggestion (DC 18), polymorph (humanoid only)</i>; 1/day - <i>
    dimension door</i>. Caster level 9th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Dhako Smogfang is the monstrosity given birth to by Jennlinn Miirdhek when she became a <ap-link-button linkName="red-lady">
    red lady</ap-link-button>. His upper body appears as a strong human covered in crimson scales from which fire erupts with a handsome face
    and a mane of fire running down his back. Below the waste, Dhako sits upon a long, serpentine tail that is covered in the same crimson
    scales with vicious spines from which fire erupts on the top of the tail.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
    While Dhako is intelligent and charismatic, he prefers to charge into combat and force his enemies into melee so that he can pull them
    into his tail and crush the life out of them. Until he has his enemies held in place, he will aggressively attack with his greataxe, or
    his claws if he is disarmed. Should a battle appear to go the wrong way, Dhako will use dimension door to escape and possibly polymorph
    to hide in plain sight, stalking his opponents until he is ready to finish them off.
