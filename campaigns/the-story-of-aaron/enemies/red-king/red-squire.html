<p>
    <i class="power">Weapon Alignment:</i>
    A red queen's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the 
    purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Battle Frenzy (Ex):</i>
    Twice per day, a red squire can work itself into a battle frenzy similar to the barbarian’s rage (+6 Strength, +6 Constitution, 
    +3 morale bonus on Will saves, -2 AC penalty). The frenzy lasts for 8 rounds, and the bearded devil suffers no ill effects afterward.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">The King's Fury (Su):</i>
    When a red squire hits with an attack, it deals damage as if the attack had the flaming enchantment. If the target is human, partially human (excepting hobgoblins),
    or is bearing a holy symbol of the Red King, the attack is treated as if it has the merciful enchantment instead of the flaming enchantment.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Wrathful Stare (Su):</i>
    A red squire may, as a standard action, focus all their rage into a single creature. The creature must make a DC 15 will save, being stunned for 1d4 turns
    on a failure or until the end of the target's next turn on a success. A red squire can use wrathful stare once per day, but the ability is recharged when
    the red squire kills a creature. The DC for wrathful stare is charisma based.
</p>
<p>
    A red squire may knock out a creature via the king's fury and attempt to use wrathful stare the following turn, as if it had killed a creature, only to waste the
    standard action.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Spell-like abilities:</i><br/>
    At will—<i>greater teleport (self plus 50 pounds of objects only)</i>. Caster level 16th.

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Every red squire is different, but the most common are 5' 5" tall men clad in a gambeson with a metal helmet. Red squires are the body guards of
    red princesses and have very little will of their own, obeying commands without any resistance or comment. Without a red princess to command them, red
    squires travel about and attack anything in their way.
</p>
<p>
    Red squires are created by red princesses from their flock, and red squires are loyal only to the red princess that created them. A red princess can only have
    one squire at a time and a red squire who has lost their red princess wonders with only vengeful blood lust.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
    Red squires always put themselves in front of their red princess, doing everything in their power to prevent harm to her. If fighting on their own,
    they will charge at any creature they see, raging before striking wildly with their bastard sword. If fighting with other creatures, a red squire will
    utilize their guisarme if it is tactically more useful than their bastard sword.
