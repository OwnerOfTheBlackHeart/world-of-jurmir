<p>
    <i class="power">Weapon Alignment:</i>
    A red princess’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the 
    purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Energy Drain (Su):</i>
    A red princess drains energy from a mortal it lures into some act of passion, or by simply planting a kiss on the victim. 
    If the target is not willing to be kissed, the red princesses must start a grapple, which provokes an attack of opportunity. 
    The red princess’s kiss or embrace bestows one negative level. The kiss also has the effect of a suggestion spell, asking 
    the victim to accept another kiss from the red princess. The victim must succeed on a DC 23 Will save to negate the effect 
    of the suggestion. The DC is 23 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. These save DCs are Charisma-based.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Spell-like abilities:</i>
    At will—charm monster (DC 22), detect good, detect thoughts (DC 20), ethereal jaunt (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), 
    suggestion (DC 21), greater teleport (self plus 50 pounds of objects only). Caster level 16th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Summon Demon (Sp):</i>
    Once per day a red princess can attempt to summon 1 vrock with a 50% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of 
    a 4th-level spell.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Change Shape (Su):</i>
    An red princess can assume the form of any Small or Medium humanoid.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Tongues (Su):</i>
    A red princess has a permanent tongues ability (as the spell, caster level 12th). red princesses usually use verbal communication 
    with mortals.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Princess’s Gifts (Su):</i>
    A red princess can grant willing humans a gift of power, granting +4 morale bonus to charisma and the ability to use Alter Self,
    as the red princess granting the spell, 3 times per day. Those granted her gifts can also add her charisma to all weapon attacks
    and damage rolls for 1 round a number of times per day equal to 3 + constitution modifier. So long as the recipient of the gift
    is on the same plane as the red princess granting it, they can communicate telepathically.
</p>
<p>
    A human accepting the gifts of a red princess may at any time be compelled by the red princess. This is as per the suggestion
    spell, except at any distance and on any plane and may be obviously harmful or unreasonable. The DC (23) for this effect is charisma
    based. Reasonable suggestions increase the DC by 1 or 2, while unreasonable suggestions decrease the DC by 1 to 5. Once compelled,
    the human cannot be compelled again for 6 hours and may not be given the same compel for 24 hours.
</p>
<p>
    A half-human, or human blooded like a tiefling, can also gain a Princess's Gifts, however they only gain 1 use of Alter Self per
    day and all bonuses gained by the gift are halved. The half-human also gains a +5 bonus to resist the red princess's suggestions.
</p>
<p>
    The red princess can maintain a number of gifts equal to her charisma modifier, ignoring temporary changes to charisma. At any
    time the human can refuse the gift or the red princess can take it back.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Every red princess is different, but the most common are beautiful women with bull-like horns on their heads. While not supremely
    stronger than red ladies, most red princess invest in armor and weapons to allow themselves a fighting chance in battle. Red princesses
    also rarely travel alone, keeping at least two personal guards (who they have given their gifts to) nearby at all times. On top of
    their normal entourage, most red princesses try to keep at least 2 scouts/spies who are gifted.
</p>
<p>
	Every red princess was once a human, tiefling, or aasimar that submitted herself before the Red King and successfully gave birth
    to a monstrosity. The most common monstrosity is that of a half-fiend minotaur, causing to the commonness of bull horns in red princess.
	Most red princesses also possess magical flight, as is listed in the statblock above. A red princess can also be the result of a red lady
	who has given birth to at least 3 monstrosities or served the Red King loyally enough that he has granted her greater power.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
    Red princesses are not warriors. While they can hold their own in a fight, they prefer to have others fight for them or stay in the
    back and support their guards with a barrage of flaming bolts. They also enjoy turning enemies against each other when they can, or
    even recruiting those who attempt to harm them.
</p>
<p>
    Red princesses, like red ladies, use their change shape ability to assume humanoid guises, and can maintain this deception indefinitely. 
    Their preferred tactic, much like red ladies, when dealing with heroes is to feign friendship and create an opportunity to be alone with 
    one of them, whereupon the red princess applies her life-draining kiss. Red princesses are not above taking on the role of a damsel in 
    distress when encountered within a dungeon. If there are humans among the heroes, red princesses will often try to recruit them before
    striking at the rest of the party.
