<p>
    <i class="power">Weapon Alignment:</i>
    A red knight's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the 
    purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Protective Aura:</i>
    Against attacks made or effects created by good creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4 resistance bonus on saving 
    throws to anyone within 20 feet of the red knight. Otherwise, it functions as a magic circle against good effect and a lesser globe of invulnerability, both with a radius 
    of 20 feet (caster level equals red knight’s HD). This aura can be dispelled, but the red knight can create it again as a free action on its next turn. (The defensive benefits 
    from the circle are not included in a red knight’s statistics block.)
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Spell-like abilities:</i><br/>
    At will—<i>bull’s strength, continual flame, detect evil, discern lies (DC 19), dispel evil (DC 20), dispel magic, unholy aura (DC 23), unholy blight (DC 19), 
        unholy word (DC 22, as holy word but for nonevil creatures), invisibility (self only), plane shift (DC 22), remove curse (DC 18), remove disease (DC 18), 
        remove fear (DC 16)</i>;<br/><br/>
    7/day—<i>cure light wounds (DC 16), see invisibility, fly (self only)</i>;<br/><br/>
    1/day—<i>blade barrier (DC 21), heal (DC 21)</i>. <br/><br/>
    Caster level 12th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Change Shape (Su):</i>
    A red knight can assume the form of any Small or Medium humanoid.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">The King's Fury (Su):</i>
    When a red knight hits with an attack, it deals damage as if the attack had the flaming enchantment. If the target is human, partially human (excepting hobgoblins),
    or is bearing a holy symbol of the Red King, the attack is treated as if it has the merciful enchantment instead of the flaming enchantment.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Wrathful Stare (Su):</i>
    A red knight may, as a standard action, focus all their rage into a single creature. The creature must make a DC 21 will save, being stunned for 1d4 turns
    on a failure or until the end of the target's next turn on a success. A red knight can use wrathful stare once per day, but the ability is recharged when
    the red knight kills a creature. The DC for wrathful stare is charisma based.
</p>
<p>
    An enraged red knight may knock out a creature via the king's fury and attempt to use wrathful stare the following turn, as if it had killed a creature, only to waste the
    standard action.

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Every red knight is different, but the most common are 6 and a half foot tall men that appear to be wearing full plate made from bone.
    The most common form of red knight does not actually wear armor, but instead has the armor growing out from their flesh.
</p>
<p>
    Unlike their lesser forms, red knights are capable of independent thought and tactics. However, a red knight serves the red queen that
    created him without question while seeking to protect her and further her goals to the best of his abilities. Due to their ability to
    operate independently, red knights are often trusted by their queens to handle dangerous and important tasks.
</p>
<p>
    Red knights are created by red queens from their flock, and red knights are loyal only to the red queen that created them. A red 
    queen can only have one knight at a time and a red knight who has lost their red queen wonders with only vengeful blood lust.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
    Most red knights prefer to be at the front of a fight, whether as a leader or as a lone fighter. While they often use their spells to
    gain the advantage, red knights gain great pleasure from killing the enemies of the Red King with their +3 greatswords. They particularly
    enjoy slaying red knights and dragons. Red knights will prioritize the lives of women of the Red King (knight, princess, and lady) over any 
    creature that isn't themselves.
