Pophagites are large, monstrous humanoids born exclusively from red queens that, much like the Red King,
draw power from eating corpses. They have tattered, bat-like wings (fly 90 ft. (good)) and gray, hairless
flesh as well as a maw with rows of teeth and eyes all over their head (360 degree vision).

Pophagites won't attack members of the Cult of the Red King or the Red King's armies, but will eat them
if they fall in battle. Pophagites also have the ability to determine the power (hit dice) of a creature
and only attack creatures that are serious threats to them in groups. If a powerful human, or human blooded,
attempts to open dialog with a pophagite, they usually will out of curiosity.
