<p>
    <i class="power">Weapon Alignment:</i>
    A red queen's natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the 
    purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">The King's Fury (Su):</i>
    When a red page hits with an attack, it deals damage as if the attack had the flaming enchantment. If the target is human, partially human (excepting hobgoblins),
    or is bearing a holy symbol of the Red King, the attack is treated as if it has the merciful enchantment instead of the flaming enchantment.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Battle Frenzy (Ex):</i>
    Twice per day, a red page can work itself into a battle frenzy similar to the barbarian’s rage (+4 Strength, +4 Constitution, 
    +2 morale bonus on Will saves, -2 AC penalty). The frenzy lasts for 6 rounds, and the bearded devil suffers no ill effects afterward.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Spell-like abilities:</i><br/>
    At will—<i>greater teleport (self plus 50 pounds of objects only)</i>. Caster level 12th.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Every red page is different, but the most common are 5' 5" tall men clad in a gambeson with a metal helmet. Red pages are the body guards of
    red ladies and have very little will of their own, obeying commands without any resistance or comment. Without a red lady to command them, red
    pages travel about and attack anything in their way.
</p>
<p>
    Red pages are created by red ladies from their flock, and red pages are loyal only to the red lady that created them. A red lady can only have
    one page at a time and a red page who has lost their red lady wonders with only vengeful blood lust.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
    Red pages always put themselves in front of their red lady, doing everything in their power to prevent harm to her. If fighting on their own,
    they will charge at any creature they see, raging before striking wildly with their bastard sword.
