<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    A human dressed in a red robe with a cowl and leather armor, cruelty and hate swirl in the exposed eyes. They pull out
    a handful of sand and a dagger as they stare at their target.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
    The cultist is not a front line fighter and will often flee if victory is not assured. When they can, they will use
    obscuring mist to cover their escape. When they do fight, they try to use command to keep their enemies from posing
    significant threats.
