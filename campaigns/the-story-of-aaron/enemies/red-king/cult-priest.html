<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    A human dressed in splint armor adorned with images of eyes recites a dark prayer and looks forward with cruelty and 
    hate in his eyes. He draws a morningstar as his prayer ends.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
    The cult priest serves to lead his fellow cultists into combat, using his spells to turn simple cultists into serious 
    threats. He isn't affraid of joining the melee himself, using the same spells to turn him into a monster of the armies
    of the Red King.
