<p>
    <i class="power">Red King's Blessing (Su):</i>
    When attacking a target that is human, or human blooded, an Abductor can apply
    the merciful enchantment to all attacks.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Unassuming Form (Su):</i>
    As an action, an Abductor can change into a form that is unarmed and unarmored.
    This form does not alter the Abductor, but allows them to change between two
    sets of equipment (armor and weapons or just basic clothes).<br/>

    When in the unassuming form, an Abductor gets +10 on disguise checks to appear
    as a harmless civilian and a +5 on bluff checks to pass as a member of the
    settlement.

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Hiding in plain sight as beautiful men and women, these agents of the cult serve a dual purpose: To recruit the vulnerable
    and to abduct those needed for the rituals of the Cult of the Red King. They are usually disguised when "on the job" within
    a settlement or out gathering information on possible recruits or targets. 
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
    Abductors generally enter combat with the intent to disable their opponents or to protect their recruits or cultmates. If they
    can they will setup ambushes or flanking attacks to allow them to utalize their sneak attack ability, but unless a wall of meat
    and steal is distracting their opponent, they will try to keep a distance and use their hand crossbows to as great an effect as 
    they can.
