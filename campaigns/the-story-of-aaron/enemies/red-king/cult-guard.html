    <i class="power">Smite Non-Human (Su):</i>
	At the beginning of an attack action (full attack or single attack), a Cult Guard can focus
	their hatred of non-humans, along with the Red King's power, to deal deadlier blows to creatures
	without human blood. When doing so, all attacks for the round made against creatures without human 
	lineage gain the Cult Guard's Constitution modifier to hit and damage.

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Kept out of public sight, this armor wall of human and steel serves to protect the halls of the cult. However, those
    who get trapped in the hidden arenas or who try to attack the cult often find these protectors standing against them.
</p>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
    The cult guard will try to get into melee range, if it can, and manually smash whatever enemy is closest. If that isn't
    an option, guards can swap to using their bows and barrage enemies from affar as other members of the cult deal with
    the problems up close.
