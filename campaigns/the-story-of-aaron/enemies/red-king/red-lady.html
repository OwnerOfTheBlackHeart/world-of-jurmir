<p>
    <i class="power">Weapon Alignment:</i>
    A red lady’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the 
    purpose of overcoming damage reduction.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Energy Drain (Su):</i>
    A red lady drains energy from a mortal it lures into some act of passion, or by simply planting a kiss on the victim. 
    If the target is not willing to be kissed, the red ladies must start a grapple, which provokes an attack of opportunity. 
    The red lady’s kiss or embrace bestows one negative level. The kiss also has the effect of a suggestion spell, asking 
    the victim to accept another kiss from the red ladies. The victim must succeed on a DC 21 Will save to negate the effect 
    of the suggestion. The DC is 21 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. These save DCs are Charisma-based.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Spell-like abilities:</i>
    At will—charm monster (DC 22), detect good, detect thoughts (DC 20), ethereal jaunt (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), 
    suggestion (DC 21), greater teleport (self plus 50 pounds of objects only). Caster level 12th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Summon Demon (Sp):</i>
    Once per day a red lady can attempt to summon 1 vrock with a 30% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of 
    a 3rd-level spell.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Change Shape (Su):</i>
    An red lady can assume the form of any Small or Medium humanoid.
</p>

<p>
    <i class="power">Tongues (Su):</i>
    A red lady has a permanent tongues ability (as the spell, caster level 12th). Red ladies usually use verbal communication 
    with mortals.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Born from non-human women who have submitted themselves to the Red King within the Void and lived long enough to
    successful birth a monsterious child, Red Ladies resemble beautiful humans with features related to their children.
    The most common are those that birth a vrock with bat wings, who then inherit the bat wings for themselves as well
    as sharp claws and red horns (that mark them as loves of the Red King).
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
    Red ladies are not warriors. They flee combat whenever they can. If forced to fight, they can attack with their claws, 
    but they prefer to turn foes against one another. Red ladies use their change shape ability to assume humanoid guise, 
    and can maintain this deception indefinitely. Their preferred tactic when dealing with heroes is to feign friendship 
    and create an opportunity to be alone with one of them, whereupon the red lady applies her life-draining kiss. Red ladies 
    are not above taking on the role of a damsel in distress when encountered within a dungeon.
