<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    A female elf stands ready to fight, but looking around. She is short and thin, even for an elf, and
    covered in heavier armor than most elves. She has charcoal black skin, silver hair, and vibrant red 
    eyes that look about with malicious intent.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
    A drow priestess does not attack first. Depending on her opponent (and if she has been seen for what
    she is), a priestess may first try to attempt diplomacy and deception to get what she wants or she 
    will throw her males at the problem first, buying enough time to get off either her escape spells or
    her battle spells, which turn her into a force to be reconned with.
