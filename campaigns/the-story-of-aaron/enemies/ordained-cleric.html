<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
	A simple priest in nothing more than the typical gold and white robes of the Cult of Durn. He caries a simple mace and the
	right to authorize marriges and baptise children.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
	If attacked, an ordained cleric is going to utalize, and support, whatever forms of guards they have available to protect 
	themselves. Otherwise, they will attempt to flee.
