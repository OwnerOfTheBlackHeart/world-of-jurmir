<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This goblin cowers behind the nearest obsticle, readying its glaive and preparing to spring its ambush. The
    painted chain shirt that this create wears give it a definite mark of at least lower level authority.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
    Golbins are typically cowards, prefering any option that grants them the advantage in a fight. The goblin sergeant
    will attempt to command his lesser breatherin in combat to maintain as many advantages as they can, but he is quick
    to flee when the going gets rough.
</p>
<p>
    Goblin sergeants prefer to attack enemies from behind a line of goblins, affording them the protection of their troops.
