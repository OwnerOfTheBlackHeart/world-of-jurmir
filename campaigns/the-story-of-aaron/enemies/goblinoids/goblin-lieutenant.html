<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This goblin cowers behind the nearest obstacle, readying its glaive and preparing to spring its ambush. The
    painted chain shirt that this cretan wears give it a definite mark of authority.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
    Golbins are typically cowards, preferring any option that grants them the advantage in a fight. The goblin lieutenant
    will attempt to command his lesser brethren in combat to maintain as many advantages as they can, but he is quick
    to flee when the going gets rough.
</p>
<p>
    Goblin lieutenants are almost never found on foot. Most will ride wargs or dire wolves into battle, being much more
    brash and aggressive than their normal goblin brethren. If they can, goblin lieutenants will try to hit and run as
    much as they can in a fight.
