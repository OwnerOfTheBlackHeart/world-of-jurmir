    <i>Light Sensitivity (Ex):</i> Kobolds are dazzled in bright sunlight or within the radius of a daylight spell.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Kobolds are short, reptilian humanoids with cowardly and sadistic tendencies.
</p>
<p>
    A kobold’s scaly skin ranges from dark rusty brown to a rusty black color. It has glowing red eyes. Its tail is nonprehensile.
    Kobolds wear ragged clothing, favoring red and orange. A kobold is 2 to 2½ feet tall and weighs 35 to 45 pounds. Kobolds speak
    Draconic with a voice that sounds like that of a yapping dog.
</p>
<p>
    These kobolds are notable from their typical brethren by small metal studs in their armor and their increased courage and discipline.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
    Kobolds like to attack with overwhelming odds—at least two to one—or trickery; should the odds fall below this threshold, they 
    usually flee. However, they attack gnomes on sight if their numbers are equal.
</p>
<p>
    They begin a fight by slinging bullets, closing only when they can see that their foes have been weakened. Whenever they can, 
    kobolds set up ambushes near trapped areas.
</p>
<p>
    When kobolds have kobold heavies available to them, they are usually sent in front. If the heavies fall, most kobolds will scatter.
