<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This gnoll stands at 8 to 8&frac12; feet tall and is covered in scars and trophies of past victories. It snarls, revealing
    teeth stained by blood. Its armor shines like silver and lightning crackles around its axe.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
    When a warlord is around, gnolls begin to fight like organized troops, but prefering small group tactics. The warlord itself
    will try to take the attentions of the prey onto itself and kill them with brutal efficiency while its underlings try to get
    around the oppenents and utalize flanking.
