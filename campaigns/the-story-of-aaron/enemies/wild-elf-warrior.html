<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This humanoid is slender and shorter than a human. Its has dark brown
    skin, pointed ears, and black hair. It is covered in thick hides and
    carries a large, heavy looking stick and a small bow.
</p>

<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>
    Wild elves of the steppes are used to not generally having stealth as an option and are
    familar with fighting on the defensive. If they can get an ambush off, they will, but
    they are also just as likely to attempt to barrage the enemy with their shortbows and
    charge in with their greatclubs.
</p>
<p>
    When not fighting for the lives of themselves and their tribes, most steppes elves will
    retreat when a battle is going poorly. If they feel it is important, they may return
    when their opponents are distracted and attack from the rear. Stepes elves are not affraid
    to drawing in wild animals or gnolls against enemies they are having trouble with.
