    Dear Guildmaster Aaron,<br>
    &emsp;The Speaker of Arx herself has asked that this mission be sent your way. She believes
    that the people of Cestrad have begun to deviate from the tenents of Durn, but the armies of
    Lyrna will not rush in blind and so we need a group of persons who won't raise alarms to
    identify the strategic locations within Cestrad.

<h3>Deal with Hobgoblin Scouts</h3>
<p>
    Dear Guildmaster,<br>
    &emsp;I am Aron Krakisson and I am a farmer just outside of Wrethian. I believe that I have
    been seeing hobgoblins moving around the fields during the night and I would be grateful
    if your guild could send someone to deal with this before it becomes a problem. The local
    guards don't believe me, but several other farmers have gathered together to help pay for 
    your services.
</p>

        Aron is a human male.

<h3>Strange Lights in the Nearby Ruins</h3>
<p>
    Dear Guildmaster,<br>
    &emsp;I'm Ottkatla Mordottir, a hunter out of Ashborne. I heard that you spent some time here
    and come by frequently. From one resident to another, would you sent someone to investigate
    the nearby ruined castle? You know, the sunken one at the base of the Copperback Mountains?
    I have seen several strange lights coming from the building and Doris is trying to fortify
    against the possible threat, rather than deal with it directly.
</p>
<p>
    <ap-auth-container permissions="aaron-full mission-notes" style="font-style: italic;">
        Ottkalta is a half-elf (wyld) female. The strange lights are being caused by cultist of
        the Red King.

<h3>Negotiate with Wyld Elves</h3>
<p>
    Dear Guildmaster,<br>
    &emsp;My name is Patrobas, and hopefully this is the last we have to deal with each other.
    I represent several buisness intrests spanning through Regra, Lyrna, and Obror who have had 
    trouble moving through the plains of Lyrna due to the interference of the native elves.
    We have found that the number of guards required to properly protect our caravans is quickly
    cutting too heavily into our profits, and your guild was brought up as a potential long-term
    solution to this issue. We seek natives of Lyrna who have the time and understanding to
    track down the problematic tribes and make deals with them to ensure the safe passage of goods
    through their territories.
</p>
<p>
    <ap-auth-container permissions="aaron-full mission-notes" style="font-style: italic;">
        Patrobas is a male elf.

<h3>Stop Gnoll Attacks on Farms</h3>
<p>
    Dear Aaron,<br>
    &emsp;It is Whiteskull. I don't know if you remember me, but I remember you. As a native of
    what your kin calls Lyrna, you are familiar with how my kin like to strike at defenseless farms
    in order to steal food and gather slaves (which they needlessly kill instead of fully utilizing)?
    Well, I would like you to send a group out to the north part of the plains and begin countering
    these raiding parties. Especially those who follow the ancient ways of the Great Hunger.
</p>
<p>
    P.S. Do you know where I could find a dwarven smith who would be willing to spend some time among
    gnolls? I can promise that he won't end up in chains.
</p>
<p>
    <ap-auth-container permissions="aaron-full mission-notes" style="font-style: italic;">
        Whiteskull is trying to make forming a gnollish civilization look like a good idea by making
        the nomadic ways look like they are no longer working.

<h3>Retrieve Holy Artifacts</h3>
<p>
    Dear Guildmaster,<br>
    &emsp;I, Nireus the Well Read, send this letter in the name of the Church. When pouring through
    scrolls and books from around 200 years ago, I found that there are several holy artifacts hidden
    within the lands of the hobgoblins. I don't want to know what would happen if those monsters had
    the chance to corrupt those symbols of purity or, even worse, if the wyld elves got their hands on
    them.
</p>
<p>
    <ap-auth-container permissions="aaron-full mission-notes" style="font-style: italic;">
        Nireus is a human male and lorekeeper at the Temple of Durn in Arx. He percieves the wyld elves
        as a great threat.
