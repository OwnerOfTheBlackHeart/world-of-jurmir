    Beloved Aaron,<br>
    &emsp;As you asked, I have created a request on the mission board for the guild members 
    to go out and handle security the mountains to the south and east of the Guild Hall. I
    don't believe that it will be easy for them, however, as there was some fierce creatures
    in the mountains last time we when up there.

    Hey Guildmaster Aaron,<br/>
    &emsp;It's Thyri, owner of Copperback Supplies. You stopped into my store once or twice. Well,
    I serve more than just handsome travelling bards, miners being the specific topic of this letter.
    One of the local mines that I sell tools and supplies to has recently ran into a kobold mine that
    is preventing them from working. I like those miners, they are nice. Oh, and Urgg has pitched in 
    some gold along with Kalta and Doris to get that mine cleared up. I guess everyone likes cheap iron.

    Dear Aaron,<br>
    &emsp;Whiteskull has told me that you provide non-gnollish living weapons for money that ask
    few questions. I have need of these living weapons. My clan requires the forging a permanent
    place into out lands and for that we require slaves. The drow were quite easy to trade with for
    flesh, but the issue is getting the slaves into our lands. I need good fighting meat to escort
    and scout for the caravan of flesh while it travels to my clan.<br/>

    Dear Guildmaster,<br>
    &emsp;I am Lady Phaia of Arx, the priestess assigned to bring Durn to quant, little Cuul.
    Recently the hunters, and some of the farmers from the throps lying around, have spoken of
    structures of wood, clay, and stone popping up in the plains. While I am worried that it could
    be hobgoblins, claims are of gnolls. Please, get rid of them before we have to deal with fortified
    gnolls.

    Dear Aaron, Chione, or Erik (travellers tell tales of your defense of the Oasis),<br>
    &emsp;It is Lethos. You are useful. Your guild is useful. Inquisitions are not.
    You have stirred up heresy and signs of it. I know you have heresy in your heart, all do.
    You are the lesser evil. Inquisitions do not properly study sinners before passing judgement.
    Clean up the signs of heresy. Protect the Speaker's radiant control.

    Dear Guildmaster,<br>
    &emsp;Are you familiar with the nasty creatures known as hobgoblins? Well they have been
    coming by sea and attacking my lands. While my small navy has been able to fend off the
    bastards, I, as a lord of Regra, do not have the power to take military action within Lyrna.
    I require a payed military force to engage the wasteful creatures at their general's
    incomplete castle to the northwest of Wrethian.
