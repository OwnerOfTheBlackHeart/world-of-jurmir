        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            The Cult of the Red King has hidden beneath the surface of society for hundreds of years,
            but now they are rising. They have been kidnapping, indoctronating, and ritualistically
            killing, doing their best to hide from the eyes of human society. It seems those that
            serve the Red King are looking to build up an army.
