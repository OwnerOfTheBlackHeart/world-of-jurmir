        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Hobgoblins have begun increasing in size, capturing slaves and forcing them to build
            great fortifications and farm great swaths of land. They have even begun to call their
            territory a nation: The Empire of 5 Generals. Leading it is Grand General Rorshath,
            with his council of Generals Pevron, Gardrak, Zodak, and Fulem.
