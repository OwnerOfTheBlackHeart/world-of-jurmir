<h1>Huntsing Down the Cult 1</h1>
<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>
    <ap-link-button linkName="hunts-on-stone">Hunts on Stone</ap-link-button> found a mysterious
    book when she was fighting the Cult of the Red King in the sunken castle while Chione was 
    waiting to bear her first children. The book is bound in relatively normal black leather, but 
    is written in a red ink and is written in voidspeak.

<h3>The Notable Sections of the Book</h3>
<p><i>
    Brothers and sisters, I have to tell you that we have been great. Our numbers have swelled
    from 4 to 12 in but a few weeks and we even have some that look like they might be ready soon
    to visit the King. We have yet to find how to visit him from here, but we will keep looking.
    <br/><br/>
    Sister Phylo

<p><i>
    Sister, we are doing well here too. Seablood is large enough for us to easily hide and has
    enough dark alleys that we have been able to find good targets for a glorious meeting with
    the King. Our prior lady has decided that we will do well without her presence and has gone
    off to show others of their duty to the world to come, so we are seeking to find someone
    we can present to the King.
    <br/><br/>
    Brother Theopompus

<p><i>
    Brother, that is great to hear. I do fear, however, that someone has noticed our presence.
    I have been forming a basic defensive force, but I do not know how long we will be able to
    hold out before we are forced to move. I have several potential inductees that I would like
    to bring with us to the new world, but their chance for such a glorious mission is growing
    slimmer by the day.
    <br/><br/>
    Sister Phylo
</i></p>
<p><i>
    Sister, we weep for your plight. We have found a target. She is no human, but she should
    easily fall to knee before the King. I see potential in her ability to guide us to a greater
    fate. We will have her soon.
    <br/><br/>
    Brother Theopompus
</i></p>
<p><i>
    Brother, we have made it to our new home. We had to leave one of the recruits behind, but he
    was not ready by the time we needed to move. The other three have been brought into the King's
    vision and are ready to serve his will. We did find a castle just north of Ashborne, so we
    will camp out there.
    <br/><br/>
    Sister Phylo
</i></p>
<p><i>
    Sister, she submitted before the King. Now we await to see what glorious servant she will bring
    us. We are also planning for something even more glorious. She has already taken to hearing the
    King and guides us down a path that he will surely smile upon. She will take us closer to the
    new world, step by step.
    <br/><br/>
