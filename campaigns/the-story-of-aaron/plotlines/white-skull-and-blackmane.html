        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
            The gnolls of the plains of Lyrna have begun to act strangely and are consolidating.
            The clan of Blackmane has rallied and begun to absorb smaller clans and is taking more
            slaves than ever before. Standing against Blackmane is the demon worshiping clan of
            Bloodclaw who is absorbing other clans with wreckless abandon.
