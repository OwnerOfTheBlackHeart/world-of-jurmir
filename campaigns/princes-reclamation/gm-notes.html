<h2>Plot</h2>

    Throughout the game, the Red King will communicate with Cody's character, giving him statements like "The mindless chaos's end near.
    It is time to prepare for the coming of order. Make it your order." The Red King's intention is to expand his influence over Indos,
    with the end goal of having the whole island become a safe haven for his worshipers to await the next age.
