<h1>Gefro Kuste, The Duchy of Two Dragons</h1>
<p>
    Ruled by a mating pair of different colored dragons, the silver XXX and the bronze YYY, Gefro Kuste is widely
    considered to be the safest and most comfortable duchy in Indos. It is also notable for the meritocratic society
    XXX and YYY work hard maintain.

    The people of Gefro Kuste are normally well fed and cared for, with the lords and ladies viewing their titles
    as jobs rather than being of higher status. Wonder lust is a common trait among the residents of Gefro Kuste.
