<p>
    Tralone, the capital city of the <ap-link-button linkName="prince-sirine">Duchy of Sirine</ap-link-button>, is a port town located where the
    Aima Zois (life blood) River meets the ocean. The city is relatively prosperous, thanks to the mix of river and ocean access as well as the
    access to cultivable land.
</p>
<p>
    Tralone is protected by an 11 foot thick, 40 foot tall outer wall with regular towers and 2 main gates, one to the south and one to the west.
    The inside of Tralone is broken into 4 districts by 8 foot thick, 30 foot tall inner walls: The castle district, the docks district, the Plousious
    (upper class) district and the Adynamos (lower class) district. The southern gate connects to the Adynamos district, while the western gate connects
    to the Plousious district.
</p>
<p>
    The buildings of Tralone are varied in composition. Due to the abundance of nearby farmland, straw and thatch houses are common among the poor while
    the relative availability of wood and clay make wattle and daub and cob common among the middle class.

<h3 id="charaxs-academic-society">Charax's Academic Society</h3>
<p>
    Charax's Academic Society is an academic society of wizards, sorcerers and mundane scholars whose main goal is to explore all there is to know about
    arcane magic. The Society itself is highly regimented, with prestige within the organization coming from one's academic achievements within the Society, 
    rank coming from a mix of time spent in the Society (tenure) and amount of work done for the Society (service), and an approach to magical research that borders 
    on the scientific method. Charax's Academic Society has a strangle hold on arcane magic resources within Tralone, and does its best to force any arcanists
    who aren't members to join and aid in the work of the Society.
</p>
<p>
    Charax's Academic Society was created roughly 50 years ago by the late Charax of <ap-link-button linkName="prince-murrabi">Murrabi</ap-link-button>, after
    disagreements about the necessity of understanding dark magics drove him north through several duchies until he arrived in 
    <ap-link-button linkName="prince-sirine">Sirine</ap-link-button>, where his will to understand all arcane magic was actively encouraged. After a few accidents
    and close calls, Charax of <ap-link-button linkName="prince-murrabi">Murrabi</ap-link-button> formed the academic society, then known as the Society for the
    Research of Arcane Entirety, as a way to take what he had learned and teach younger mages how to "safely" study with dark magics, as well as to expand
    the amount of arcane research that could be done.
</p>
<p>
    Charax's Academic Society is based out of the <a href="#eos-hall-of-learning">Eos of Zelthaus Hall of Learning</a>.

<h3 id="cycleum-temple">The Cycleum</h3>
<p>
    Located at the meeting point of <a href="#aima-zois-castle">Aima Zois Castle's</a> outer walls and the intersection of the Plousious and Adynamos districts,
    the Cycleum is a circular temple made of cob. While the temple is grand in scale, the publicly visible parts of the temple are modestly decorated, with only
    a few paintings of important leaders and events as well as iron sculptures of two arms forming a circle by grabbing each other's forearm, which is the symbol
    of the Cycleum.
</p>
<p>
    The publicly available portions of the Cycleum are the central courtyard, which has a small garden and relaxation area, and about a third of the Cycleum building,
    which includes a shrine room available for public services and a confessions room where one can speak to the clergy or donate to the Cycleum. Outsiders to the 
    Cycleum are told that the worship at the Cycleum is based around worshiping the 3 universal parts of any cycle: The beginning, middle and end. They also preach
    that one should not fear the end of a cycle, for it is the beginning of a new cycle.
</p>
<p>
    Those who have been initiated by the Cycleum, or can prove that they've been initiated by another temple within the
    <ap-link-button linkName="prince-sirine">Duchy of Sirine</ap-link-button>, are allowed access to another 3rd of the temple. This third contains ritual rooms,
    worship chambers, and a commons area, all of which are decorated with iconography of the <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button>.
</p>
<p>
    The final third is only available to the active clergy of the Cycleum, and contains their sleeping quarters and other rooms important to the running of the
    temple.

<h3 id="eos-hall-of-learning">The Eos of <ap-link-button linkName="prince-zelthaus">Zelthaus</ap-link-button> Hall of Learning</h3>
<p>
    A large, 5 story building made of sandstone with a marble facade, the Eos of Zelthaus Hall of Learning is the center of public knowledge within
    <ap-link-button linkName="prince-sirine">Sirine</ap-link-button>. The library is made up of the original building, which is the nicest part of the library
    and the only part that is the entire 5 stories tall, along with 6 separate expansions, 2 of which are dedicated to 
    <a href="#charaxs-academic-society">Charax's Academic Society</a> use. Rather than using full floors, the main library building uses balcony floors
    for all of the floors above the ground floor, with a manually operated cargo elevator at the center of the original building that allows entire bookshelves
    to be carried between floors.
</p>
<p>
    The Eos of Zelthaus Hall of Learning is named after Eos of Zelthaus, a of the retainer of the first Duke of 
    <ap-link-button linkName="prince-sirine">Sirine</ap-link-button>, Duchess Scoth Nic Thámhais. Duchess Scoth placed great value on knowledge and learning,
    ordering the creation of the library and commanding her retainers to gather tomes of important knowledge, such as practical skills or magic. 
    Eos of Zelthaus gathered 100 such tomes, more than 4 times as many as the next most successful retainer, all of which were donated to the Library's collection.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="#charaxs-academic-society">Charax's Academic Society</a> operates out of the Hall of Learning.
</p>

<h3 id="aima-zois-castle">Aima Zois Castle</h3>
<p>
    Sat atop a hill on the north end of Tralone, Aima Zios Castle is a beautiful round stone castle, though it is small by the standards of dukes' castles.
    The keep of the castle is surrounded by an inner and an outer wall, with the space between the two walls housing the permanent guards of the castle as
    well as the guards' compound, which contains the dungeons, guard captain's office and training yards. Inside the inner wall, a series of 8 gardens with
    no particular meaning divide up the yard surrounding the castle with supporting buildings scattered about the guards. The main castle is made of a mix of
    round and square stone construction, with elegant decorations that can be slightly unnerving to those not used to <a href="#otto-of-sirine">Duke Otto</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Aima Zois Castle serves as <a href="#otto-of-sirine">Duke Otto's</a> castle.
</p>
<p>
    The Aima Zois Castle is named after the Aima Zois River, which Tralone sits on.
</p>
