<p>
    Tralone, the capital city of the <ap-link-button linkName="prince-sirine">Duchy of Sirine</ap-link-button>, is a port town located where the
    Aima Zois (life blood) River meets the ocean. The city is relatively prosperous, thanks to the mix of river and ocean access as well as the
    access to cultivable land.
</p>
<p>
    Tralone is protected by an 11 foot thick, 40 foot tall outer wall with regular towers and 2 main gates, one to the south and one to the west.
    The inside of Tralone is broken into 4 districts by 8 foot thick, 30 foot tall inner walls: The castle district, the docks district, the Plousious
    (upper class) district and the Adynamos (lower class) district. The southern gate connects to the Adynamos district, while the western gate connects
    to the Plousious district.
</p>
<p>
    The buildings of Tralone are varied in composition. Due to the abundance of nearby farmland, straw and thatch houses are common among the poor while
    the relative availability of wood and clay make wattle and daub and cob common among the middle class.

<h3 id="cycleum-temple">The Cycleum</h3>
<p>
    Located at the meeting point of <a href="#aima-zois-castle">Aima Zois Castle's</a> outer walls and the intersection of the Plousious and Adynamos districts,
    the Cycleum is a circular temple made of cob. While the temple is grand in scale, the publicly visible parts of the temple are modestly decorated, with only
    a few paintings of important leaders and events as well as iron sculptures of two arms forming a circle by grabbing each other's forearm, which is the symbol
    of the Cycleum.
</p>
<p>
    The publicly available portions of the Cycleum are the central courtyard, which has a small garden and relaxation area, and about a third of the Cycleum building,
    which includes a shrine room available for public services and a confessions room where one can speak to the clergy or donate to the Cycleum. Outsiders to the 
    Cycleum are told that the worship at the Cycleum is based around worshiping the 3 universal parts of any cycle: The beginning, middle and end. They also preach
    that one should not fear the end of a cycle, for it is the beginning of a new cycle.
</p>
<p>
    Those who have been initiated by the Cycleum, or can prove that they've been initiated by another temple within the
    <ap-link-button linkName="prince-sirine">Duchy of Sirine</ap-link-button>, are allowed access to another 3rd of the temple. This third contains ritual rooms,
    worship chambers, and a commons area, all of which are decorated with iconography of the <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button>.
</p>
<p>
    The final third is only available to the active clergy of the Cycleum, and contains their sleeping quarters and other rooms important to the running of the
    temple.
