<h1>The Duchy of Sirine</h1>
<p>
    Compared to the other duchies, Sirine's people are much more isolationistic. While they aren't necessarily friendly to outsiders,
    they aren't friendly either. They have a notably higher population of tieflings and aasimars compared to the other duchies and
    have a reputation as being a safe haven for half-orcs and half-elves.

    <p>
        The people of Sirine secretly worship the Red King. They believe that the current state of the world indicates that the end
        isn't yet and are content to live their lives and wait for the call of the next age.
