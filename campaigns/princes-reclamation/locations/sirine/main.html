<h1>The Duchy of Sirine</h1>
<p>
    Compared to the other duchies, Sirine's people are much more isolationistic. While they aren't necessarily friendly to outsiders,
    they aren't friendly either. They have a notably higher population of tieflings and aasimars compared to the other duchies and
    have a reputation as being a safe haven for half-orcs and half-elves.

        The people of Sirine secretly worship the Red King. They believe that the current state of the world indicates that the end
        isn't yet and are content to live their lives and wait for the call of the next age.

<p>
    Sirine <b>likes</b> <ap-link-button linkName="prince-eisiger-fel">Eisiger Fel</ap-link-button> because they form a barrier against the
    rest of the kingdom, enjoy relaxed trading with Sirine, and are similarly suspicious of outsiders.
    <ap-auth-container permissions="gm prince-full sirine-religion" inline>
        The people of Sirine are also more accepting of <ap-link-button linkName="prince-eisiger-fel">Eisiger Fel</ap-link-button>
        because they are mainly human, goliath and giant.

<p>
    Sirine <b>hates</b> <ap-link-button linkName="prince-akrida">Akrida</ap-link-button> because the people of 
    <ap-link-button linkName="prince-akrida">Akrida</ap-link-button> are too nosey and are constantly trying to interfere in their 
    affairs or convert them to Lyrnanism.
</p>
<p>
    Sirine <b>hates</b> <ap-link-button linkName="prince-idanthus">Idanthus</ap-link-button> because they frequently send traders and
    missionaries, both of which have like to stay longer than they are welcome.
    <ap-auth-container permissions="gm prince-full sirine-religion" inline>
        The people of Sirine also don't like <ap-link-button linkName="prince-idanthus">Idanthus</ap-link-button> because Idanthus
        is made up of dwarves that refused to accept, what the people of Sirine see as, their rightful end.
