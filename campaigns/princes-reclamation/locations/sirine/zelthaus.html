<p>
    Zelthaus is a village located off the Ammolofos (dune) River. The village has no wall, though a 40 foot tall watchtower serves as the main
    defense of Zelthaus, giving the militia time to ready themselves for any approaching threat.
</p>
<p>
    Due to the lack of access to forests, clay or quarries, Zelthaus builds primarily out of alchemically bonded sand bricks.

<h3 id="melnaki">Melnaki the Dune Skimmer</h3>
<p>
    Melnaki is an adult male blue dragon who has claimed Zelthaus as a part of his territory. In exchange for regular tithes, Melnaki doesn't attack Zelthaus
    or lead desert travelers astray. On occasions where Melnaki believes that attackers will take valuables outside of his territory, he will attack forces
    that are attacking Zelthaus.
</p>
<p>
    Melnaki is called the Dune Skimmer for his habit of flying low and fast along the desert dunes as exercise and practice, and a little bit of an adrenaline rush.
