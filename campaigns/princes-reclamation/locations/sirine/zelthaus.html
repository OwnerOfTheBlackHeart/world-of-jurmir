<p>
    Zelthaus is a village located off the Ammolofos (dune) River. The village has no wall, though a 40 foot tall watchtower serves as the main
    defense of Zelthaus, giving the militia time to ready themselves for any approaching threat.
</p>
<p>
    Due to the lack of access to forests, clay or quarries, Zelthaus builds primarily out of alchemically bonded sand bricks.
</p>
<p>
    The primary export of Zelthaus is spices, many of which grow well on the fertile banks of the Ammolofos River.

<h3 id="melnaki">Melnaki the Dune Skimmer</h3>
<p>
    Melnaki is an adult male blue dragon who has claimed Zelthaus as a part of his territory. In exchange for regular tithes, Melnaki doesn't attack Zelthaus
    or lead desert travelers astray. On occasions where Melnaki believes that attackers will take valuables outside of his territory, he will attack forces
    that are attacking Zelthaus.
</p>
<p>
    Melnaki is called the Dune Skimmer for his habit of flying low and fast along the desert dunes as exercise and practice, and a little bit of an adrenaline rush.
</p>

<h3 id="home-builders-guild">The Home Builders' Guild</h3>
<p>
    The Home Builders' Guild is a skilled workers' guild that specializes in producing, and building with, alchemically bonded sand bricks. The guild holds a
    monopoly on these materials and aggressively works to maintain it.
</p>
<p>
    Beyond their ability to manipulate the prices and availability of buildings and their construction materials, the Home Builders' Guild has little other 
    power.
</p>
<p>
    The Home Builders' Guild operates out of the <a href="#home-builders-guild-offices">Home Builders' Guild Offices</a>.

<p>
    Gizor is generally fairly lenient as a guard captain and tends to only punish severe crimes, usually in extreme measures. When he is ordered to, or is otherwise

    and a black silk wristband.
</p>
<p>
    Diomira is focused on her duties as mayor, though she is well aware of the general disregard of complex laws of her subjects. She does her best to be pleasant,
    though the nagging of <a href="#melnaki">Melnaki's</a> toadies can make Diomira short fused.
</p>
<p>
    Diomira lives out of, and has court in, <a href="#zelthaus-manor">Zelthaus Manor</a>.
</p>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm prince-full diomira-melnaki-history">
    <p>
        Diomira became mayor of Zelthaus after agents of <a href="#melnaki">Melnaki the Dune Skimmer</a> assassinated the prior mayor and her family,
        prompting <a href="#cephalos">Sir Cephalos of Tralone</a> to promote Diomira to mayor. Now, Diomira is little more than a puppet for

    blue toga with silver threads woven in and a red hooded poncho, with 5 silver rings and a rose gold necklace as jewelry.
</p>
<p>
    Cephalos is generally too busy performing his knightly duties to give anyone not related to them his full attention, so he often seems aloof or uncaring.
    However, those that have had his full attention know that Cephalos is more interesting in advancing himself and appearing successful than anything else.
</p>
<p>
    Due to his responsibilities, Cephalos doesn't spend much time in Zelthaus, but when he does, he stays at <a href="#zelthaus-manor">Zelthaus Manor</a>.

</p>
<p>
    Colubra sometimes sells elven-style thread, though she can only do this in small batches as her main job at the

        Colubra was originally born in <ap-link-button linkName="prince-enon">Enon</ap-link-button> to a fling between a native human and a wild elf.

    A small, sand brick house owned by <ap-link-button linkName="prince-kaja">Kaja</ap-link-button>.
</p>

<h3 id="unis">Uni's</h3>
<p>
    Uni's is a deep, 1 story building made of plastered, alchemically bonded sand brick with a simple iron sign of a bag of feed and a fishing net.
    The front door of Uni's is a sheet of sandy, red-brown fabric tightly covering a lattice of stiff copper bands with a simple pull handle and a
    short iron door bar. The inside of Uni's is made up of a front room, which has an uncovered sand floor with a mix of alchemically bonded sand and
    dried clay shelves on which the "front goods" are displayed, and the "back room" where <a href="#uni-hafrsson">Uni</a> himself lives, as well as
    stores goods to valuable to leave public access. A door similar to the front door separates the front and back rooms. Cut into the sections where
    the roof and walls meet are small vents with solid iron covers that are opened or closed depending on the season.
</p>
<p>
    Like most of the buildings in Zelthaus, Uni's has a flat roof accessible by a set of stairs attached to the side of the building. This section of
    Uni's is mostly unused, though <a href="#uni-hafrsson">Uni</a> can be found sleeping on it, weather permitting.
</p>
<p>
    Uni's sells most basic tools, foods, and animal care goods, but advanced or bulk goods aren't generally available at Uni's. Uni's doesn't handle
    trade with "merchants," preferring to focus on the people as the customer base, and local craftsman and farmers as the suppliers.
</p>
<p>
    Uni's is owned and operated by <a href="#uni-hafrsson">Uni Hafrsson</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="zelthaus-iron-works">Zelthaus Iron Works</h3>
<p>
    Zelthaus Iron Works is a 2 story building made of plastered, alchemically bonded sand brick with a roofed forge area in front. The front door of the
    Iron Works, which is a sturdy dried clay slab with a handle, is within hammer range of the forge and is guarded by <a href="#telesinus">Telesinus</a>
    when he works. Only a few pieces are kept on finely made wooden displays while the Iron Works is open, with the pieces and their displays being taken
    inside when the Iron Works closes. Along the side of the building is a set of stairs that wraps around the smaller second story up to the sleeping area
    on the top of the Iron Works.
</p>
<p>
    While tools can be custom ordered at Zelthaus Iron Works, most of the tools made at the Iron Works are sold to <a href="#unis">Uni's</a>.
    Instead, the common items sold by the Iron Works itself are weapons, armor, horse shoes and repairs.
</p>
<p>
    Zelthaus Iron Works is owned and operated by <a href="#telesinus">Telesinus</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="temple-of-life">The Temple of Life</h3>
<p>
    The Temple of Life is a single story, partially underground building made of alchemically bonded sand with a foundation made of fitted river stone.
    The inside of the temple is broken into two areas, the entry area where anyone is allowed that has a basic shrine and plentiful tapestries depicting
    the cycle of blood and water motif, and the worship area, where the actual shrine and sanctuary are, as well as the various facilities for the clergy.
    Unlike many of the buildings within Zelthaus, the outside of the Temple of Life looks like a short pyramid with 3 ventilation towers.
</p>
<p>
    The Temple of Life claims to worship the cycle of life, which they visualize as the cycle of blood and water, where blood represents life and water represents the
    elements. In reality, the Temple of Life worships the <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button>, but the areas where the
    <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button> are worshiped are only available to those initiated into the Temple of Life, or who can prove they
    have been initiated by another temple within the <ap-link-button linkName="prince-sirine">Duchy of Sirine</ap-link-button>.
</p>
<p>
    The acting Cycler of the Temple of Life is <a href="#torrad-varsson">Torrad Varsson</a>.

<h3 id="zelthaus-manor">Zelthaus Manor</h3>
<p>
    Zelthaus Manor is a 3 story mansion with a plastered, alchemically bonded sand brick first floor, the outside of which painted with beautiful murals of the
    Ammolofos River throughout the seasons, with a wattle and daub second and third floor. The manor is large, with a great hall taking up the center of the
    manor, 10 guest rooms, and ample room for servants, as well as a private study and sitting room for important guests. The interior of Zelthaus Manor is
    filled with paintings, tapestries, and other such decorations, though a style clash is occurring as <a href="#diomira">Mayor Diomira</a> is replacing
    the more traditional Lyrnan styled decorations with the dyed furs and paintings of astronomically significant designs common to native goliath society.
</p>
<p>
    Zelthaus Manor is the home and court of <a href="#diomira">Mayor Diomira</a>, as well as containing the office of 
    <a href="#gizor-thordsson">Guard Captain Gizor Thordsson</a>. When he is in Zelthaus, <a href="#cephalos">Sir Cephalos of Tralone</a> 
    stays at Zelthaus Manor.
</p>

<h3 id="home-builders-guild-offices">The Home Builders' Guild Offices</h3>
<p>
    The Home Builders' Guild Offices, sometimes called Home Builders' Headquarters, is a massive 3 story building that is a testament to what is possible with
    alchemically bonded stone brick architecture, using arches, columns and decorative buttresses of different styles throughout its construction, as well as
    crenellations and machicolations on the roof. Most of the inside of the offices are available only to members of the Guild, unless the non-member has approval
    or an escort, but the main offices in the front of the building, entered through a set of large, wooden doors, are open to the public. The rest of the building
    is made up of offices and workshops of various sizes, lounge areas, a kitchen and the vault, with the upper floors accessed through internal stair cases.
    The roof of the Home Builders' Guild Offices is a single, large garden and lounge area, with pavilions and gazebos scattered about that are used for entertaining
    customers and guild members alike, and a bar that is open during the night.
</p>
<p>
    These offices are where the <a href="#home-builders-guild">Home Builders' Guild</a> is based out of. <a href="#colubra">Colubra of Tralone</a> serves as the 
    Administrator of Order Management and as the office manager.
