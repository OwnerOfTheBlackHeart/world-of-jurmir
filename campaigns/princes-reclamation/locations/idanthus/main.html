<h1>Idanthus, The Artificial Mountain</h1>
<p>
    The Duchy of Idanthus is named after the artificial mountain Idanthus, which sits at the center of the Duchy.
    Idanthus is know as the place to go for new beginnings.
</p>
<p>
    The dwarves of Idanthus are a generally cheerful lot with a hopeful outlook for the future. They openly welcome
    outsiders and are happy to offer support in times of need or sadness.
</p>
<p>
    Clan Chiseltide, the largest clan within Idanthus, made the mountain after their prior mountain was destroyed by a
    volcanic eruption.

<p>
    While Idanthus presents itself as a single, coordinated entity, it is really a collection of city states that have
    sworn fealty to the High Clanmaster, XXX.
