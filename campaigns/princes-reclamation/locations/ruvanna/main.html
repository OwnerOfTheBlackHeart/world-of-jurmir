<h1>Ruvanna, The Dream Forest</h1>
<p>
    Made up of elven grove that banded together for protection against the green dragon <ap-link-button linkName="prince-duke-umur"> Umur, The People Collector</ap-link-button>, 
    who rules over <ap-link-button linkName="prince-grunbaum">Grunbaum</ap-link-button>. Ruvanna is well known for the
    many hallucinogenic plants that hide among the underbrush.
</p>
<p>
    The elves of Ruvanna are a fearful and protective lot. They particularly fear the other races and are
    quick to flee if they sense danger.
</p>
<p>
    The Ruvannian elves are the last hold out of the native elves of the island, the unique dangers of their
    forest offering the protection that has allowed them to survive as they have. While the wild and wood elves
    generally don't like the fact that they have been absorbed into "civilized" society, the high elves actively
    work to use the system to their protection.
</p>
<p>
    The elves of Ruvanna are evenly split between high elf, wild elf and wood elf.
</p>
<p>
    Ruvanna is officially ruled over by <ap-link-button linkName="prince-therlas-ilaro">Duchess Therlas Ilaro</ap-link-button>.

    Ruvanna <b>doesn't like</b> any other factions because they view them all as the people who pushed them out
    of their traditional homes.
</p>
<p>
    Ruvanna <b>hates</b> <ap-link-button linkName="prince-grunbaum">Grunbaum</ap-link-button> because they consistently
    send raiding parties to steal, kill and capture from Ruvanna.
</p>
<p>
    Ruvanna <b>hates</b> <ap-link-button linkName="prince-gefro-kuste">Gefro Kuste</ap-link-button> because they
    blame them for not getting rid of the local evil dragons and consider their inaction as equal to the actions
    of the evil dragons.
