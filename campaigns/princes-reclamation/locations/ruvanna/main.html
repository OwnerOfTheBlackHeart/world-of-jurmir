<p>
    The elves of Ruvanna are a fearful and protective lot. They particularly fear the other races and are
    quick to flee if they sense danger.

<p>
    The Ruvannian elves are the last hold out of the native elves of the island, the unique dangers of their
    forest offering the protection that has allowed them to survive as they have. While the wild and wood elves
    generally don't like the fact that they have been absorbed into "civilized" society, the high elves actively
    work to use the system to their protection.

<p>
    The elves of Ruvanna are evenly split between high elf, wild elf and wood elf.
