<h1>Grunbaum, The Great Green Forest</h1>
<p>
    Ruled over by the green dragon XXX, Grunbaum is a massive forest with villages built into, and among, the trees.
</p>
<p>
    The people of Grunbaum are friendly and loyal, but they also tend to be hardened by their relatively wild lifestyle.
    It is no secret that the government of Grunbaum is corrupt, and the vast majority of its workers will take "donations,"
    but not a one would go against orders from XXX, direct or indirect.
