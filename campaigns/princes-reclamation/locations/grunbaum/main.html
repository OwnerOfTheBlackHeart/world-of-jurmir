<h1>Grunbaum, The Great Green Forest</h1>
<p>
    Ruled over by the green dragon <ap-link-button linkName="prince-duke-umur">Duke Umur, The People Collector</ap-link-button>, Grunbaum is a massive 
    forest with villages built into, and among, the trees.
</p>
<p>
    The people of Grunbaum are friendly and loyal, but they also tend to be hardened by their relatively wild lifestyle.
    It is no secret that the government of Grunbaum is corrupt, and the vast majority of its workers will take "donations,"
    but not a one would go against orders from <ap-link-button linkName="prince-duke-umur">Duke Umur</ap-link-button>, direct or indirect.
</p>
<p>
    Grunbaum is known for its slave trade.

    Grunbaum <b>likes</b> <ap-link-button linkName="prince-eisiger-fel">Eisiger Fel</ap-link-button> because they have a
    defense agreement with <ap-link-button linkName="prince-eisiger-fel">Eisiger Fel</ap-link-button> and can easily trade
    slaves within their borders.
</p>
<p>
    Grunbaum <b>hates</b> <ap-link-button linkName="prince-idanthus">Idanthus</ap-link-button> because the artificial mountain
    destroyed the forests where it originally was and has, to an extent, disrupted the weather on the island. Grunbaum also
    doesn't like that they can't wipe those smug smiles off of the faces in 
    <ap-link-button linkName="prince-idanthus">Idanthus</ap-link-button> without provoking multiple attacks in return.
</p>
<p>
    Grunbaum <b>hates</b> <ap-link-button linkName="prince-ruvanna">Ruvanna</ap-link-button> because they are food and slaves,
    and the consideration of elves as people is insulting.
