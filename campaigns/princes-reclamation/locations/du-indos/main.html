<h1>Du Indos, Capital Duchy of Indos</h1>
<p>
    Ruled by Duke XXX, Du Indos is the duchy in which the royal family rules from. While King Pedaeus of Heminus has allowed his kingdom to
    decay, just to live in decadence, Duke XXX has been keeping Du Indos under control. He has also been trying to keep the whole kingdom
    from separating, with limited success.
</p>
<p>
    The people of Du Indos are used to being important and are frustrated with their king slowly losing their influence. They generally treat
    outsiders as they would any other stranger.

    Du Indos, being the capital of Indos, has no special relations with any other duchies. Most view them as trying to save a dying kingdom.
