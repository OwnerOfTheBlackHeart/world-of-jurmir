<p>
    Melite came to Indos after a short career in pit fighting, seeking a life with more opportunity than Cytherna had to offer her.
    She settled in the Duchy of <ap-link-button linkName="prince-akrida">Akrida</ap-link-button>, though she quickly found herself
    outshined by the clerics and paladins, with the National Church of the Gods handling most of the work she would normally be able
    to take.

<p>
    Melite has two real goals: To actually own a nice house of her own and to prove herself... mainly to herself.
