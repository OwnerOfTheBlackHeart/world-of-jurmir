<ap-image linkName="prince-yrsa-halladottir-img" class="character-picture" height="500">Picture of Yrsa</ap-image>
<p>
    Yrsa is a dwarven druid from <ap-link-button linkName="prince-idanthus">Idanthus</ap-link-button>, being the first of the native
    born to undertake a journey outside of the mountain.
</p>
<p>
    Yrsa is a cheerful and curious type who is looking forward to experiencing more of the world. She has an interest in these creatures
    called birds and how fun flying sounds.
</p>
<p>
    Yrsa wears a bra of holding that was given to her by the patron mothers of her home town, partially because it was a gift and
    partially because it's convenient not having a pair of dwarven tits in the way of casting.
