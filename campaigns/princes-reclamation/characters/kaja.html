<p>
    Kaja is a female tiefling from the Duchy of <ap-link-button linkName="prince-sirine">Sirine</ap-link-button>. 
    She learned wizardry because she always found people scarrier than magic.
</p>
<p>
    It is worth noting that Kaja finds social situations scary, but has no problem facing people down in violent conflict. In fact,
    her demonic blood will occasionally "boil" and she will become far more sinister for several seconds. When her blood "boils", she
    produces a faint smell of sulfur and her red eyes glow.
</p>
<p>
    Kaja is true neutral, but "boiling" Kaja is chaotic evil.
