<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Veldego is a 5' 4" tall, female half-dragon human who may be found among the court of <ap-link-button linkName="prince-duke-umur">Duke Umur</ap-link-button>.
    While Veldego has a limited amount of martial skill, most of it comes from her half-dragon heritage. Instead, she prefers to think of herself as
    a scholar and master of the mind.
</p>
<p>
    The dragon-hide scale mail that Veldego wears is made from the scales of <ap-link-button linkName="prince-duchess-myli">Duchess Myli</ap-link-button>, 
    which Veldego paid well to have stolen for her over the course of nearly a decade, which she is highly proud of. Her armor is a good guide as to what
    Veldego views as worthy of being in her horde: Gems and trophies, especially those with stories or taken from enemies she particularly hates, are
    her favored pieces, while Veldego places little value in coins beyond their ability to get her items she actually wants.
</p>
<p>
    Underneath her armor, Veldego wears a garment consisting of 3 long, blue-green silk "sashes" that she wraps around her torso in order to prevent
    her armor from rubbing (and causing unwanted shedding), while not burdening her with a full gambeson or, 
    <ap-link-button linkName="kyranious">Kyranious</ap-link-button> forbid, forcing her to wear peasant cloth.
</p>
<p>
    All of Veldego's clothes are made of a smooth silk that slides cleanly across her scales without catching or ripping. They also have the side-effect
    of being breathable and looking nice.
</p>
<p>
    Veldego has D cup titties.
</p>

<h2 id="random-findings">Random Findings of Note</h2>
<ul class="list">
    <ap-auth-container permissions="gm prince-full veldego-sexual-characteristics dora">
        <li>
            Veldego is a feminine herm and has a 9 inch penis.
        </li>
    </ap-auth-container>
</ul>

<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>
    While Veldego is capable of melee combat, she prefers to rely on charm and energy ray to get her through fights, while her own allies shield
    her from danger. If she runs out of power points, or has particularly distracting allies, Veldego may dive into combat, striking at a lone,
    weak enemy with as many attacks as she can manage.
</p>

<h2 id="history-and-motivation">History and Motivation</h2>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm veldego-history prince-full dora">
    <p>
        Veldego is the daughter of <ap-link-button linkName="prince-duke-umur">Duke Umur</ap-link-button> and Rochelle, a late native woman that
        <ap-link-button linkName="prince-duke-umur">Duke Umur</ap-link-button> liked because she had green hair. Because of the fact that
        <ap-link-button linkName="prince-duke-umur">Duke Umur</ap-link-button> can't add Veldego to his collection, because she is <b>HIS</b>
        daughter, he only cares for her as much as she can be useful to him.
    </p>
    <p>
        While <ap-link-button linkName="prince-duke-umur">Duke Umur</ap-link-button> may be a cruel, manipulative and power hungry dragon, he was
        a good father, teaching Veldego everything he believed she would need to survive with only the title Lady, even going so far as to encourage
        her fascination with the rare and odd powers of psionics. This wouldn't last forever, as once she became an adult, capable of caring for herself,
        devising and executing her own plots, and forming her own contact networks, Veldego ceased to be anything more than a trusted and valued
        retainer to <ap-link-button linkName="prince-duke-umur">Duke Umur</ap-link-button>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Veldego's first plot, which <ap-link-button linkName="prince-duke-umur">Duke Umur</ap-link-button> supported heavily, was to steal enough
        scales from <ap-link-button linkName="prince-duchess-myli">Duchess Myli</ap-link-button> to construct a suit of armor for herself. She started
        the plot by hiring several kobold merchants to scout <ap-link-button linkName="prince-murrabi">Murrabi</ap-link-button> and the den of the
        pair of metallic dragons. Once Veldego felt she had enough information, she sent out 9 kobolds and 1 human, "rented" to her by her father,
        to establish themselves in <ap-link-button linkName="prince-gefro-kuste">Gefro Kuste's</ap-link-button> court. She then had her "spies"
        seek to either join, or bribe, those in charge of cleaning <ap-link-button linkName="prince-duchess-myli">Duchess Myli</ap-link-button>'s
        den and horde. Over the course of 5 years, Veldego's plot was able to get her the scales she needed, including one that was plucked off
        of <ap-link-button linkName="prince-duchess-myli">Duchess Myli</ap-link-button> while she slept, which Veldego had placed directly under
        the breast armor, so as to display the large scale openly.
    </p>
</ap-auth-container>
<ap-auth-container permissions="gm veldego-motivation prince-full dora">
    <p>
        Veldego's primary motivator is the draconic greed running through her veins, especially when it comes to gems, though she
        will occasionally do things just to get new trophies to add to her, currently, small collection. She is also motivated by
        her capacity to hold long, and sometimes unexpected, grudges and her own lusts, though of her "strong" motivators, lust is
        her weakest.
    </p>
    <p>
        Veldego's picked up some of her father's love of collecting people, resulting in a will to own/control those she takes a
        strong liking to. This control can vary from her trying to get the target of her favor to perform tasks for her amusement to
        establishing sexual dominance and control to downright enslavement, if there is a legal manner for her to do so. 
        Veldego is not above using her telepathic powers in order to keep her slaves/servants happy, passive and under control.
