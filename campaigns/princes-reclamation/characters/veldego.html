<ap-image linkName="prince-veldego-img" class="character-picture" height="500">Picture of Veldego</ap-image>
<p>
    Veldego is a female half-dragon human who may be found among the court of <ap-link-button linkName="prince-duke-umur">Duke Umur</ap-link-button>.
    While Veldego has a limited amount of martial skill, most of it comes from her half-dragon heritage. Instead, she prefers to think of herself as
    a scholar and master of the mind.
</p>
<p>
    The dragon-hide scale mail that Veldego wears is made from the scales of <ap-link-button linkName="prince-duchess-myli">Duchess Myli</ap-link-button>, 
    which Veldego paid well to have stolen for her over the course of nearly a decade, which she is highly proud of. Her armor is a good guide as to what
    Veldego views as worthy of being in her horde: Gems and trophies, especially those with stories or taken from enemies she particularly hates, are
    her favored pieces, while Veldego places little value in coins, beyond their ability to get her items she actually wants.

        Veldego is the daughter of <ap-link-button linkName="prince-duke-umur">Duke Umur</ap-link-button> and Rochelle, a late native woman that
        <ap-link-button linkName="prince-duke-umur">Duke Umur</ap-link-button> liked because she had green hair. Because of the fact that
        <ap-link-button linkName="prince-duke-umur">Duke Umur</ap-link-button> can't add Veldego to his collection, because she is <b>HIS</b>
        daughter, he only cares for her as much as she can be useful to him.
