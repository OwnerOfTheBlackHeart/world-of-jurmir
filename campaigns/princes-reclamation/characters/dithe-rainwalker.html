<p>
    Dithe is a tribal goliath barbarian from the Duchy of <ap-link-button linkName="prince-eisiger-fel">Eisiger Fel</ap-link-button>. 
    She is excitable and loves to compete, even when she shouldn't. One of the easiest ways to piss her off is to make it so that she 
    is forced to decide between aiding those she cares about and "getting more points." She will almost always aid those she cares 
    about, but Sithrak have no fury like she will.
