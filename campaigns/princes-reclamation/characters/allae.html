<ap-image linkName="prince-allae-img" class="character-picture" height="500">Picture of Allae</ap-image>
<p>
    Allae is a fearful elf from the <ap-link-button linkName="prince-ruvanna">Ruvanna</ap-link-button> Duchy. She travels now
    because she was caught in a raid from <ap-link-button linkName="prince-grunbaum">Grunbaum</ap-link-button> and got lost,
    leading her to have more contact with the rest of Indos than other elves.
</p>
<p>
    While Allae is perfectly capable of navigating social situations, she is constantly afraid of one thing or another. She learned
    magic due to the general fear of all the big strong people outside her home forests. She is also acutely aware of the fact that
    she has a terrible sense of what is, and isn't, dangerous.
</p>
<p>
    Allae refers to herself as a woman, however she is actually a feminine male.
