<p>
    Zardril is a drustkin drow who ended up in <ap-link-button linkName="prince-du-indos">Du Indos</ap-link-button> after getting kicked
    out of Underdark Breweries. She doesn't like to talk about why she was kicked out.
</p>
<p>
    Zardril has a strange mix of submissive and aggressive behavior, doing exactly as her superiors command her, but always looking to get
    inferiors of her own. She hates admitting failure and will often bend, or break, rules and orders in order to "fix" her "mistakes,"
    even if they were out of her control. When she has inferiors, she encourages them to make mistakes in controlled environments so that
    can learn from their mistakes without actually failing.
</p>
<p>
    Zardril was kicked out of Underdark Breweries after she stole from a client that had failed to pay. She did it because the client had
    failed to pay and she didn't want to have to inform one of her superiors that one of her contracts defaulted.
