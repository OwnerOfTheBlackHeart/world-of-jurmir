<p>
    Rayner is a human sorcerer from <ap-link-button linkName="prince-gefro-kuste">Gefro Kuste</ap-link-button>. 
    He is proud of his noble heritage and of the fact that his family has managed to maintain their status in the 
    meritocracy of <ap-link-button linkName="prince-gefro-kuste">Gefro Kuste</ap-link-button>. He claims to draw 
    power from dragonblood, and his love of collecting rare coins and fine paintings only seem to support his claim.
