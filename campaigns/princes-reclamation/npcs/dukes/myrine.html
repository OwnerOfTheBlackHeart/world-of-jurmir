<p>
    A middle aged, female gnome, Duchess Myrine has served the royal family since the first king, Pylas of Cuul. When
    Pylas noticed that his end was nearing and that his son, the now king Pedaeus of Heminus, had fallen to the pleasures
    of hedonistic <ap-link-button linkName="sithrak">Sithrak</ap-link-button> worship, Pylas placed Myrine in the seat of
    Duchess of <ap-link-button linkName="prince-du-indos">Du Indos</ap-link-button> with the instructions to keep Indos 
    intact through Pedaeus's reign.
</p>
<p>
    Myrine takes her task seriously and, while she hasn't been able to truly keep Indos in line, she has been able to stay
    on the positive side of all the other dukes and duchesses. While she hasn't publicly insulted King Pedaeus, she hasn't
    hidden the fact that she is looking forward to the next king's reign.
</p>
<p>
    Myrine has a patient, and sometimes even aloof, attitude, but she does take her job seriously. She likes to listen to
    all sides of an issue and find the solution that is the best for both sides. However, these "best solutions" take time
    and have been a point of friction during times where a rapid response was required. Myrine is aware of this fact, but
    has done little to address it.
</p>
<p>
    Myrine likes to dress in simple, but fine, clothing. She prefers white and light yellow dresses and underclothes with
    a green or blue mantle, cloak, or coat (depending on time of year) and the small gold headband that symbolizes the
    office of the Duke of <ap-link-button linkName="prince-du-indos">Du Indos</ap-link-button>.
