<p>
    Duke Otto is a tiefling male. While his clothes are all of noble quality, his favored colors are black, vibrant red, and muted greens and browns.
</p>
<p>
    Duke Otto has a certain regalness to him and takes care to act the part of a leader. He dresses well, practices appropriate responses, methods
    of movement, dancing, etc., and maintains a small collection of retainers. In person, he is patient and considerate with humans-blooded, but can be
    quite impatient with non-humans. Otto has a particular distaste of elves, doubly so for native elves.
</p>
<p>
    Otto supports legislation that increases the autonomy of the dukedoms and the independence from the Holy Lyrnan Empire, as well as legislation that
    reduces the authority of religious organizations and the freedom of inquisitors. In terms of local politics, he pushes individual privacy and limiting
    the actions of bounty hunters and inquisitors, which is all worded to appear more like respecting privacy, rather than enabling crime or cults.
</p>
<p>
    Otto generally avoids noble functions where he is not needed, as both his nature as a tiefling and as his title of Duke of 
    <ap-link-button linkName="prince-sirine">Sirine</ap-link-button> make him endure constant scrutiny and suspicion from the other nobility.
