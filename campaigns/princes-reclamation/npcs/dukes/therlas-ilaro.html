<p>
    Therlas is a female elf. Therlas wears simple clothes for a duchess, preferring to garb herself in a set of purple robes
    with teal to green embroidery and a matching lining. Therlas usually carries a satchel with her spellbook and 2 enchanted
    daggers, one which is a +1 bane (dragon), the other being +1 flaming.
</p>
<p>
    Therlas moves with the expected grace of an elf, and a little more, and is skilled in traditional elven song and dance,
    though she often lacks the "noble air" about her. However, Therlas tries to maintain a strong retainer presence, with most
    of her retainers being kept nearby. While Therlas generally acts respectful around other nobility, it is no secret that she
    shares the sentiment of her dukedom when it comes to non-elves.
</p>
<p>
    Therlas supports legislation that restricts the ability of dukedoms to operate outside their borders, that restrict or
    abolish slavery, and that might cause division among the other dukes. Locally, Therlas spends a great deal of effort
    hunting down the spies of other dukes, securing her borders against raids from 
    <ap-link-button linkName="prince-grunbaum">Grunbaum</ap-link-button>, and slowly pushing her people into well protected
    fortresses.
</p>
<p>
    Therlas prefers to avoid noble functions and actively avoids <ap-link-button linkName="prince-duke-umur">Duke Umur</ap-link-button>.

        Therlas rightfully fears that <ap-link-button linkName="prince-duke-umur">Duke Umur</ap-link-button> wishes to add her
        to his collection. She believes that he will bite off her limbs then have his servants cause her to regenerate them as
        a kind of infinite food farm.
