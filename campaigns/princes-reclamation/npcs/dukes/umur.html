<h1>Duke Umur, The People Collector of Grunbaum</h1>
<ap-image linkName="prince-duke-umur-img" class="character-picture" height="500">Picture of Umur</ap-image>
<p>
    Umur is the male, mature adult, green dragon DC (16) who rules over <ap-link-button linkName="prince-grunbaum">Grunbaum</ap-link-button>. He is known for
    his authoritarian leadership style and his support of the slave trade.
</p>
<p>
    Duke Umur has many other titles, such as Ratslayer, Deer Hunter, Elf Eater, or Treekeeper, though the title he earned through his most recent hobby, 
    collecting and breeding humanoids with rare traits, is his favorite by far.
</p>
<p>
    Duke Umur has an understanding of exactly where he stands politically and physically, and is more than willing to work with those of a higher status than
    him, though those of equal status must ensure that Umur will benefit enough from their exchange in order to having him work with them. Umur enjoys the feeling
    of being in control and will give strange, or nonsensical, orders to test the loyalty of those under his command. Umur is a dragon of his word and will
    go through <ap-link-button linkName="hell">Hell</ap-link-button> just to ensure that his agreements and promises are kept, however, he is also exceedingly 
    careful of what he is willing to agree to. Just because Umur is true to any agreement he makes doesn't mean that he isn't willing to lie. 
</p>
<p>
    Umur supports legislation that weakens the good aligned leaders and improves the slave trade. Locally, Umur focuses on his war with Ruvanna, expanding his
    slave trade (namely so that he has more opportunity to find exotic/strange humanoids for his collection), and on punishing those that disobey his orders.
    As long as they follow his commands and pay their taxes, Umur doesn't care if an official is corrupt.

        Umur likes to fuck <ap-link-button linkName="prince-duchess-ammetu">Duchess Ammetu</ap-link-button> any time 
        they meet and he is more than happy to be take humanoids up on offers of sex, though he does so for his pleasure, 
        not theirs. If someone pleases him, he will allow them to mate with his collection. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Umur likes to occasionally fuck members of his collection. Umur is gentle when he fucks the members of
        his collection that are prized and/or willing additions.
