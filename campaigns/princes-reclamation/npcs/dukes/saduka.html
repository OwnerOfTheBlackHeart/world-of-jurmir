<p>
    Duke Saduka is a young adult (CR 13) male silver dragon. When in dragon form, Saduka moves with a confident strut and exudes
    an aura of nobility. In "noble" form, Saduka appears as a silver haired elf wearing a fine military uniform with a cane, which
    is topped with a gold sphere, in which he keeps a scale of his mate,

    Saduka is always polite and respectful, holding himself to a high standard even when those around him stoop to vile lows, and
    he takes great pride in his honor. When not managing <ap-link-button linkName="prince-gefro-kuste">Gefro Kuste</ap-link-button>
    or spending time with <ap-link-button linkName="prince-duchess-myli">Myli</ap-link-button>, he practices noble etiquette and
    skills.

<p>
    Saduka supports legislation that helps improve the security and unity of the duchies, protects the merchant class, makes the
    noble class serve the people more, and otherwise encourages meritocracy, though he also supports having an increased military
    presence, to better protect the people from attack. In terms of local politics, Saduka focuses on managing the merchant and
    noble classes, as well as pushing for a well organized, trained and behaved professional military force.
