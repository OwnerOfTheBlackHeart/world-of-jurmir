<p>
    Duchess Myli is a young adult (CR 12), female, bronze dragon. When in dragon form, she marches around with the pride, presences,
    and total ego that is common among the children of <ap-link-button linkName="kyranious">Kyranious</ap-link-button>. When in her
    "noble" form, Myli appears as a copper lizardfolk dressed in purple silks without any jewelry, though she does like to travel
    with a pair of stone golems with gold-filled etchings.

    When in her "noble" form, Myli moves with a proud, noble grace, but holds back on the overpowering ego and confidence of her natural
    form (namely so that she doesn't accidentally intimidate other nobility). Regardless of how much below her she views someone, it is
    hard to get Myli not to like you, though she finds particular interest in people who are performers or artists.

    Myli supports legislation that helps encourage good behavior, reduces corruption, and supports meritocracy, though she also generally
    supports improving the navy. In terms of local politics, Myli focuses on supporting the "lower classes," sailors, and dockworkers,
    as well as working with the guilds to ensure clean and efficient operation.
