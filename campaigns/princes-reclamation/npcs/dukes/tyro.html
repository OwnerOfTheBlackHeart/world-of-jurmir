    Tyro likes to show off her wealth using her revealing attire. The garments are weaved from valuable, fine thread, local fabrics 
    and dyed in expensive purple dyes from Lyrna.

        Despite her supposed piousness, Tyro is vulnerable to conversion to the Red King and the Red King wants her under his
        control. This can be either through control via the Bright One or by actually turning her to the Red King.
