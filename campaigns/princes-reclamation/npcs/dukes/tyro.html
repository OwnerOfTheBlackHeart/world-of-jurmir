<p>
    The human duchess Tyro of Arx is a traditional lyrnan leader, a female cleric of <ap-link-button linkName="durn">Durn</ap-link-button>, though some rumors 
    among the noble class suggest that Tyro might also have a strong connection with <ap-link-button linkName="hrefna">Hrefna</ap-link-button>. She endeavors to
    keep the people of <ap-link-button linkName="prince-akrida">Akrida</ap-link-button> living the lyrnan way.
</p>
<p>
    Tyro likes to show off her wealth using her revealing attire. The garments are weaved from valuable, fine thread, local fabrics and dyed in expensive purple 
    dyes from Lyrna. She also has a preference for blue gems, particularly dwarven cut, dark blue gems.
</p>
<p>
    Tyro generally plays the nice and caring role in public, though in private she is constantly looking to help fortify, or improve, her political position.
    She does care for the general populace, but only if they don't threaten her political power. 
</p>
<p>
    Duchess Tyro supports legislation that encourages people to live a more lyrnan lifestyle, improve the authority of the Church of Durn, and increase the naval
    power of Indos. Locally, she focuses on forming a connection with the rest of the Holy Lyrnan Empire through which traditional goods can be brought in and on 
    counter cult operations.

        Despite her supposed piousness, Tyro is vulnerable to conversion to the Red King and the Red King wants her under his
        control. This can be either through control via the Bright One or by actually turning her to the Red King.

        Tyro has used the excuse of someone being a member of a dangerous cult as a way to remove political rivals. She also maintains a small group of assassins
        with no official connection to her.
