    Cretheus is a fat, aging, male dwarf. Cretheus dress like a merchant, in clothes designed to show off wealth rather than to
    be "in fashion," with no preference for colors, though Cretheus favors gold above silver and platinum. Cretheus
    wears excessive jewelry.

<p>
    While Cretheus is polite, he prefers to act more fatherly than nobly, trying to offer guidance and connections to those
    who feels he needs it, while gently letting people down when their plan is foolish or unlikely to work. Unlike many nobles,
    Cretheus does not bother practicing dancing or elegant movement, instead wattling around with the confidence of a house patriarch.

<p>
    Cretheus supports legislation that produces a thriving economy and protects both suppliers (such as merchants and tradesmen) and
    purchasers. In terms of local politics, Cretheus puts a heavy focus on preventing corruption, ensuring criminals are treated fairly,
    that courts and trails are conducted with dignity, and that criminals have rehabilitation and education opportunities available to them.

    Due to his advancing age, Cretheus prefers to host noble functions.
