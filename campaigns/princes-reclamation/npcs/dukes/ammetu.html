<p>
    Duchess Ammetu is an old (CR 15) female white dragon who rules over <ap-link-button linkName="prince-eisiger-fel">Wisiger Fel</ap-link-button>.
    Despite her age and experience, she isn't a particularly good ruler, relying instead on her counts and countesses, made up of goliaths and the smarter
    varieties of giant, to handle the vast majority of the actual rulership.
</p>
<p>
    Ammetu is slow to trust new people and can quickly become hostile with those she doesn't trust. However, if one can gain the trust of Ammetu, they will
    find an amicable dragon who will gladly trust them with tasks that she cannot handle herself. Often, Ammetu's greatest worries are her own personal safety,
    to the point that she will often disguise herself as a goliath when she needs to leave her fortified lair.
</p>
<p>
    Ammetu is slightly paranoid about <ap-link-button linkName="prince-duke-saduka">Duke Saduka, The Winged Knight</ap-link-button> and 
    <ap-link-button linkName="prince-duchess-myli">Duchess Myli, The Guardian of the Coast</ap-link-button>, fearing that they are constantly trying to
    have her killed. This has slightly informed her belief that an outsider without goods is likely to be a spy or an assassin. Ammetu has more trust in
    traders and merchants than she should.
</p>
<p>
    Ammetu supports legislation that encourages trade and the exchange of goods. She is against legislation which restricts what goods can be traded. For
    local policies, Ammetu focuses on the ability to have any physical good available for trade and having freedom and protection for traders and merchants.
    Ammetu has also focused her armed forces on counter-intelligence operations and fortification building.

        Ammetu is more than happy to have <ap-link-button linkName="prince-duke-umur">Duke Umur</ap-link-button> mate
        her, as it makes her feel like she is a worthy mate. She denies any accusations that Umur rapes her or that he
        has conditioned her to be sexually open to him.
