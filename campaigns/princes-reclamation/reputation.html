<h1>Reputation</h1>
<p>
    <ap-reputation-ranks-table class="float-right"></ap-reputation-ranks-table>
    The information presented below is meant to help create a system for tracking and managing reputation among multiple factions.
    The first major objective of the campaign is to get to Accepted Heir (reputation rank 10) with at least 4 of the major factions,
    which is done by completing missions and adventures for each faction.
</p>
<p>
    Each faction has 3 main pieces of information: The current reputation XP/points, their allies, and their enemies. You acquire
    reputation XP/points by completing missions for a faction, with the number of points gained up completion being equal to the CR 
    of the highest CR encounter you overcame (not avoided) as part of the mission. When you gain reputation XP/points with a faction,
    you lose half as many reputation XP/points (rounded down) from their enemy factions. Missions which grant you only 1 faction 
    XP/point are generally considered beneath notice. If the mission also benefited any factions that are allies of the faction you
    completed the mission for, the allied factions gain one quarter as many reputation XP/points (rounded down). Missions which grant
    you 3, or less, faction XP/points are generally considered beneath the notice of allied factions.
</p>
<p>
    As you gain, or lose, reputation with factions, your faction rank with them will change. To determine your faction rank, compare the
    amount of reputation points with the faction in question against the reputation ranks table. Most members of a faction will be vaguely
    aware of you if you have a rank of 5, or higher, while well informed members will recognize you at rank 4, gossips and other socialites
    that keep careful track of people will recognize you at rank 3 and members that are in the area you have helped will recognize you at
    rank 2.
</p>
<p>
    Depending on the faction and the situation, your rank may offer you benefits such as favors, housing, food and drink, gifts, or donations
    to your current mission. If you get a high enough reputation rank in some factions, they may offer you land and/or property in order
    to keep you working with them.
