    The Red King is the old god who devoured the other old gods and whose jealousy gave birth to
    the humans and the current gods. He waits within the Void for the seals that bind him in place
    to weaken enough for him to escape. 
</p>
<p>
    The Red King seeks the destruction of all the gods and the slaughter of everything that isn't
    under his control. He seeks to "finish" his human race so that they may be sent to kill the gods
    and cleanse the world he views as his, and his alone.
</p>
<p>
    The Red King looks like a disfigured, crimson red horned god with many eyes and one massive eye
    on his chest. Some depictions show him as a knight clad in crimson full plate with a massive, 
    predatory maw filled with large, serrated teeth coming from underneath the helmet.
</p>
<p>
    The Red King's name as an old god was Churnobog.
