    Durn, the god of civilization, is generally known as the god of law-bound species (such as
    humans, halflings, and dwarves). He is commonly worshipped by good nobility and guardsmen.
    He is also regarded as the king of the gods. During the War of the Red King, he
    created the halflings.

    Durn is the brother of Sithrak, the Cruel Judge. After he came to realize to how cruel his
    brother was, he exiled Sithrak to Hell to become the judge and warden of the prison of vile
    souls.
