    Durn, the god of civilization, is generally known as the god of law-bound species (such as
    humans, halflings, and dwarves). He is commonly worshipped by good nobility and guardsmen.
    He is also regarded as the king of the gods. During the War of the Red King, he
    created the halflings.

    Durn is the brother of Sithrak, the Cruel Judge. After he came to realize to how cruel his
    brother was, he exiled Sithrak to <ap-link-button linkName="hell">Hell</ap-link-button> to become the judge and warden of the prison of vile
    souls.

	While Durn is not a god of commerce or money, it isn't uncommon for his clergy to handle the
	production and tracking of currency within civilizations that lack other institutions to do
	so.

	While many races worship Durn, dwarves and halflings are his truest servants. Humans, with their
	inherently varied nature, worship Durn only when he appeals to them. Elves, on the other hand,
	have an odd relationship with Durn, often loving his gifts and his meaning, but often find his
	worship too stringent. Though, in areas where elves are more lawful, they flock quickly to Durn
	for his wisdom and guidance on how to rule.
