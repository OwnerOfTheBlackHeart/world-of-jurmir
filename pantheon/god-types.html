<h1>The Types of Gods</h1>
<p>
    In Jurmir, gods can generally be put into two categories: The celestial gods and the living gods.
    The celestial gods, also called greater gods, generally remain off of the Material Plane, but
    remain able to influence it either way. The living gods, or lesser gods, generally live on the
    planes they influence, but still qualify as gods because of their ability to grant spells.
</p>

<p>
    Only the most exceptional of mortals with decades of preperation have even a hope of harming a
    celestial god, due to the immense power they have. Living gods, on the other hand, are far less 
    powerful. Some are weak enough that they may even be able to be killed by an unprepared, but skilled,
    mortal. Some will require the mortal find one, or more, weaknesses to exploit when attacking the
    living god.

<h2>Examples of Living Gods</h2>
<p>
    While celestial gods are a simple concept to grasp, what can be a living god may take a few examples
    to be understood. Many outsiders and fey can, under certain curcumstances, gain the ability to grant
    spells and become living gods themselves. They generally gain power over the a limited domain and area,
    such as the Lady in the Lake (a driad living god) who can control all weather within 5 miles of her
    lake and bless or curse crops within that same radius. Another example might be Lyciaca, a dire wolf
    who became a living god after eating an angel and demon that had killed eachother in battle, who roams
    her forest and whose temperment can turn the vary forest angry.
