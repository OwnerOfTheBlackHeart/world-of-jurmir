	Feph, the God of Messages and Omens, is the god in charge of delivering messages from other gods,
	or groups of gods. He sends messages in many forms, such as dreams or strange events, and serves
	to act as a barrier when the gods want mortals to know information, but don't want to give up too
	much information. All of the messages that Feph delivers involve wolves or eagles in some manner,
	as if a calling card to mortal kind.
</p>
<p>
	Feph is worshipped primarily by messengers and prophets, but is regularly prayed to by those seeking
	foresight. Most rituals and prayers to Feph are done at small shrines made of round stones picked
	from the surrounding area. A shrine is considered to be accepted by Feph if wolves stalk around it.
	When a shrine to Feph is erected within a city, it is as a simple temple that also serves as a central hub
	for mail and other forms of communication. Such temples have the walls and pillars covered in depictions
	of eagles and wolves.
</p>
<p>
	Feph himself appears as a slender human with strong legs and a wolf with an eagle on its back. The
	wolf that Feph has with him at all times is named Vidos (male) and the eagle is named Etia (female).
	Feph is the son of the gods Lagos and Hrefna.
</p>
<p>
	Feph is the child of Hrefna and Lindo, before he became a lich.

<p>
	While many scholars have debated the reasons behind almost every planet having analogs for both
	wolves and eagles, the most commonly accepted reason is that Feph requires them as messengers, and as 
	such, places them on every planet.
