	Hrefna Aridottir was once a common huntswoman who lived in the isolated Orutol Forest, which would
	become the grasslands of Lyrna some time later. She was wise and kind and a master of domesticating wild
	animals and an even better hunter. Over her mortal lifespan she would keep her small village alive through
	many springs and winters with her ability to bring home pelts and meat. She ascended to godhood due to
	Lindo's affections.
</p>
<p>
	Hrefna has born a single child, Feph, with Lindo before he became a lich, which Hrefna was against. She
	raised both Lindo and Feph.
</p>
<p>
	Hrefna is commonly worshipped by hunters, breeders, druids, and farmers, but those seeking to bear child
	will also pray to Hrefna. Her shrines resemble hunting blinds and other forms of camouflage which are
	placed in natural areas where they can be hunted from. Rituals to Hrefna often involve hunting or food
	animal sacrifices (like cattle or chickens).
</p>
<p>
	Hrefna is portrayed as an attractive Lyrnin woman with curly black hair and 3 pointers. The names of the
	pointers are Thord, Antheia, and Iamus.
