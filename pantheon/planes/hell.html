<h1>Hell, The Eternal Prison</h1>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>
    Hell appears to exist within a cavern miles high with a floor of pure, raging flame, with landmasses of ashy and charred stone
    floating about and storms of thick, black, choking smoke. Throughout Hell are seven "pillars," which all points in Hell are
    equidistant to, requiring only a single thought and step in order to arrive at any of the seven pillars of Hell. At the dead
    center of Hell rests a seemingly bottomless pit, called <a href="#derin-ates-deligi">Derin Ates Deligi</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The landmasses can range from the size of a house to that of continents and may be barren flat rock, settlements
    of cowering souls seeking to avoid the gaze of <ap-link-button linkName="sithrak">Sithrak</ap-link-button>, great prisons run
    by the emberred, or even colonies of devils and demons.
</p>
<p>
    When not acted upon, the landmasses of Hell float about in orderly, predetermined patterns, never colliding or nearing each other
    in a manner that almost seems like a dance. When a creature is on a landmass and possesses the knowledge of how to do so, they
    may command the landmass to move across the Sea of Flame, though any creature capable of controlling the landmass who possesses
    more hit dice may override their "order."

<h3 id="tower-of-judgement">The Tower of Judgement</h3>
<p>
    Carved out of one of the pillars of Hell and floating over <a href="#derin-ates-deligi">Derin Ates Deligi</a>, the Tower of Judgement is where 
    souls go in Hell to be judged. Filling the tower are rooms filled with embers in service to <ap-link-button linkName="sithrak">Sithrak</ap-link-button> 
    as well as a seemingly endless spiralling, staired hallway that leads to the open top of the tower, which is known as The Court of Final Judgement.
</p>
<p>
    The Court of Final Judgement consists of little more than a small entrance coming up from the floor, a flat, clear area where those being
    judged stand, and the massive throne of <ap-link-button linkName="sithrak">Sithrak</ap-link-button> himself. What the throne is made is unclear,
    due to the thick char that covers it, though it's shape is that of hard rectangles made in the vague shape of a throne.
</p>
<p>
    The "island" that the Tower of Judgement is on sits almost 100 feet above the rest of the landmasses, held to the edges of 
    <a href="#derin-ates-deligi">Derin Ates Deligi</a> by massive chains and hooks.
</p>

<h3 id="derin-ates-deligi">Derin Ates Deligi</h3>
<p>
    Roughly translating to "Deep Fire Hole," Derin Ates Deligi is the pit at the center of Hell, directly below the
    <a href="#tower-of-judgement">Tower of Judgement</a>. The pit itself is almost circular and is large enough to swallow an entire continent, with
    countless ash-stone fortifications place around the ring and guarded by every type of denizen in Hell, some of which guard the hooked chains
    that keep <a href="#tower-of-judgement">Tower of Judgement</a> where it is above Derin Ates Deligi. Fire pours like liquid from the rim of the
    pit down into its depths.
</p>
<p>
    Only <ap-link-button linkName="sithrak">Sithrak</ap-link-button> and the guards of Derin Ates Deligi know what truly lies below, though 
    the fact that the forces that guard Derin Ates Deligi do so without defection or conflict, scholars believe that it must be something that either
    threatens all existence or some great, but sinful, good.
</p>

<h3 id="yangin-evi">Yangin Evi</h3>
<p>
    Formed around one of the seven pillars of Hell, Yangin Evi is the largest continent in Hell and is home primarily to devils. Countless fortified
    settlements dot Yangin Evi, where devils trade knowledge, contracts, souls and goods while doing their best to avoid the gaze of
    <ap-link-button linkName="sithrak">Sithrak</ap-link-button>. The government(s) of Yangin Evi, while constantly shifting as arch-devils compete
    for power, are well organized and militaristic.
</p>
<p>
    The "capital" of Yangin Evi is Savas Sehri, the fortified city at the base of the pillar, garrisoned with countless devils ready to fight any
    forces of <ap-link-button linkName="sithrak">Sithrak</ap-link-button> that dare tread on Yangin Evi.
</p>

<h3 id="gunah-yeri">Gunah Yeri</h3>
<p>
    A constantly shifting continental mass primarily populated by demons, Gunah Yeri is considered to be one of the most dangerous places in Hell
    for mortals to travel to. Due to the fact that <ap-link-button linkName="sithrak">Sithrak</ap-link-button> regularly sends forces to invade
    Gunah Yeri or cull its demon population, the pillar that resides on the continent is usually kept near its edge.
</p>
<p>
    The settlements of Gunah Yeri appear and disappear sporadically, with demons gathering for odd, and often random seeming, reasons, then disappearing
    out into the wilds of Gunah Yeri as soon as the reason they gathered is no longer there.
</p>

<h2 id="devils">Devils</h2>
<p>
    Believed to be the original denizens of Hell, the devils of Hell are constantly looking for ways to dethrone and unbind 
    <ap-link-button linkName="sithrak">Sithrak</ap-link-button>. Despite this, the fact that devils are masters of getting others to sin while avoiding 
    sin themselves, or using contracts and other agreements to place the sin of their actions on another, most devils can safely exist around
    the Hateful Judge himself.

    <h2 id="history">The History of Hell</h2>
    <p>
        Before <ap-link-button linkName="sithrak">Sithrak</ap-link-button> claimed the plane of Hell, it was little more than a seemly endless cavern 
        with a floor of liquid fire and the occasional passing devil, who hunted for souls that they could feed to the fires of Hell. Many believed 
        that the old god Zoltar had a residence in Hell, though there is currently no way to prove, or disprove, that idea.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the Red King began to lose in his war against <ap-link-button linkName="kyranious">Kyranious</ap-link-button> and the new gods, he managed
        to hire a small legion of devils to delay the advancing armies of his enemies. How he was able to gather so many devils at once, or what he
        exchanged for their service, is unknown even to this day.
    </p>
    <p>
        After the defeat of the <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">Red King</ap-link-button> and Zoltar, Hell had a period of rest before 
        <ap-link-button linkName="sithrak">Sithrak</ap-link-button> moved in and began reshaping Hell to his whims. It is around this time that devil
        populations began to soar, suggesting some form of response to <ap-link-button linkName="sithrak">Sithrak</ap-link-button>'s presence.
        Many planar historians argue as to whether the rise in devil populations was a result of the new flow of vile souls that
        <ap-link-button linkName="sithrak">Sithrak</ap-link-button> brought with him or are evidence that Hell has an intelligence all its own that
        controls the devils and their numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
        A second mass increase in the devil population happened when <ap-link-button linkName="sithrak">Sithrak</ap-link-button> was done with his changes
        to Hell and bound the plane to himself by planting the Spikes of Absolute Control into his eyes. The cause of the second spike is also unknown,
        though the leading theories are that the spike was due to <ap-link-button linkName="sithrak">Sithrak</ap-link-button>'s power and the energies of
        Hell mixing, that Hell once again proved itself intelligent, or that when he bound himself to the plane, 
        <ap-link-button linkName="sithrak">Sithrak</ap-link-button> brought even more vile souls into Hell.
    </p>
    <p>
        When and how <a href="#derin-ates-deligi">Derin Ates Deligi</a> was created is still a mystery, as well as what lies at the bottom.
