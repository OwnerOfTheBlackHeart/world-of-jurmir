<h1>How the Planes Connect</h1>
<p>
    The planes of Jurmir are not seperated by some aether or empty space. 
    They are not overlayed, requiring spells or special attunement to access them.
    They are connected. When a person finds the points where they connect,
    the person can walk between the planes as easily as they walk into and out of
    a home.
</p>

<p>
    The center of Jurmir is the Material Plane. It is from here that all other planes
    can accessed. The planes, however, only connect in certain places. These places
    are broken up into 3 sections: The surface, the overdark, and the underdark.
</p>

<p>
    The surface of the Material Plane is the portion exposed to the sky, made up of
    forests, oceans, mountains, deserts, and more. This is where most of the "good"
    races call home and connects to the overdark through tunnels in the mountains
    or in the ground. At the tops of the highest mountains, the doorways to Horgverold
    can be found. The Material also connects to Frostgard in the far north, at the tip
    of the world.
</p>

<p>
    The overdark is the section of the Material Plane which is up to 5 miles deep. Here the underground
    is what you'd expect, mostly lifeless except for creatures that feed off of the
    waters that flow from the surface or the creatures that gather food from the surface.
    The most common sapient creatures in the overdark are dwarves and kobolds, but almost
    all monstrous races are willing to live in deep caves that would be considered part
    of the overdark. The overdark itself connects to Dysvegr via the river Cain.
</p>

<p>
    The underdark is the section of the Material Plane which is beyond 5 miles deep.
    The underdark is generally considered the most dangerous part of the material plane.
    Within the underdark is an almost alien ecosystem of lethal herbivores, hungry maneaters,
    and fungal forests. The native sapients of the underdark are the drow and the duergar.
    By finding the cracks in the underdark, a mortal can find their way to the Void or they
    can find the gates to <ap-link-button linkName="hell">Hell</ap-link-button>, almost always guarded by a Warden of Sithrak. Due to the
    planes to which the underdark connects, many believe that it was once a buffer to
    protect the rest of the Material Plane and the other planes from the great evils
    of <ap-link-button linkName="hell">Hell</ap-link-button> and the <ap-link-button linkName="the-void">Void</ap-link-button>.
