<h1>The Void, Prison of the Red King</h1>
<p>
    The Void is an empty plane that serves as the prison of <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">the Red King</ap-link-button>. Throughout the Void itself
    float the many chunks of <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">the Red King</ap-link-button>, which are slowly pulling themselves together, aided by the
    souls who have given themselves to <ap-link-button linkName="red-king">the Red King</ap-link-button>.
</p>
<p>
    Due to the fact that the Void is basically a planar empty space, great magical locks within the Underdark are used to keep the void from pulling materials
    from other planes into it, as well as to keep its own contents from escaping.
