	Kyranious, First of the Dragons and Mother of the Mortal Dragons, is the last remaining
	old god (though some scholars debate that Zoltan counts as an old god). She is worshipped
	by both the dragons, who she gave birth to the first of, and the kobolds, which she created
	from the scales of dragons.

<p>
	Kyranious created the gods Durn, Sithrak, and Kriotz after she survived an attack by the
	Red King.

	For the followers of Kyranious, not much has changed. However, the Mother of Dragons has
	had increasingly worse relations with Kriotz and Hipha over their insistence of magic and
	technology remaining mostly separate. Kyranious's stance on the matter is that magic and
	technology are both sources of power and wealth and thus both are worthy of dragonkin's
	hording and utilization.
