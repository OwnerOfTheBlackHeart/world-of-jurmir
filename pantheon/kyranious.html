	Kyranious, First of the Dragons and Mother of the Mortal Dragons, is the last remaining
	old god (though some scholars debate that Zoltan counts as an old god). She is worshipped
	by both all types dragons, who she gave birth to the first of, and the kobolds, which she created
	from the scales of dragons. She is normally portrayed as a dragon large as a mountain with
	scales that appear white and ghostly, but in the right light show the colors of all dragons.
</p>
<p>
	Kyranious created the gods Durn, Sithrak, and Kriotz after she survived an attack by the
	Red King.

<h2>Mortal Relations</h2>
<p>
	Kyranious, and dragonkind in general, have a love/hate relationship with the dwarves. As master
	craftsmen and expert miners, the dwarves produce some of the most coveted items a dragon could
	want, but they also hunt dragons and kobolds and fight against Kyranious's creations for control
	over valuable ore veins. This relationship is further complicated by the fact that Kyranious
	was both a lover and a rival to Steele, the old god who crafted the dwarves in his image.
</p>

<h2>Starfinder</h2>
<p>
	For the followers of Kyranious, not much has changed. However, the Mother of Dragons has
	had increasingly worse relations with Kriotz and Hipha over their insistence of magic and
	technology remaining mostly separate. Kyranious's stance on the matter is that magic and
	technology are both sources of power and wealth and thus both are worthy of dragonkin's
	hording and utilization.
