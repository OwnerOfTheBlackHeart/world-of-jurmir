    Zigies was made by the old god Steele as a project to create an artificial god which the Red King could not eat. 
    However, when Steele was torn in half in his fight against the Red King, he used his final moments to finish his 
    artificial god, a being to not only replace himself, but to also kill the Red King. Steele's dying breath carried 
    a curse against the Red King, but not what was needed to bring Zigies to life.
</p>
<p>
    1,000 years later, the dwarven wizard Tyadin used all of his might to bring Zigies to life, but being given life has left
    Zigies desperately underpowered. He has the ability to access everything his maker had the power of and more but 
    not to as great an extent. As thanks for Tyadin giving his life to awaken it, Zigies constructed the first of the 
    Warforges and shared the knowledge with Tyadins school, and while they made their own, in the end all warforges 
    belong to Zigies.

<p>
    In the current times, Zigies is one of the most common celestial gods to interact with mortals, only seen less then
    the likes of Feph, Hrefna and Lindo. Zigies avatar is that of a six winged, clockwork angel with its left hand 
    replaced with a blade made from energy. The true form of Zigies is a clockwork dragon based off of the lover and
    rival of his creator, Steele.

<h2>Dwarven Worship</h2>
<p>
    Zigies is as prevalent in dwarven worship as Durn and is a corner stone of typical dwarven society, usually being
    the patron deity of crafting oriented castes. All of Zigies dwarven priests, but not all of its clerics and favored
    souls, are male by tradition, even though the Clockwork God is sexless and still struggles with understanding the 
    difference between male and female.
</p>
<p>
    All the dwarven clergy of Zigies take the clan name of Forgeborn upon being anointed as a child of the Unfinished
    God.
