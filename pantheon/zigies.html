<h1>Zigies, the Clockwork God</h1>
<p>
    Zigies is the god of crafting, the unfinished, and the abandoned.
</p>
<p>
    Zigies was created by the old god who created the dwarves during the Red King's rampage.
    The dwarves' old god was eaten by the Red King before he could complete Zigies, but after
    the Red King was imprisoned within the Void, Zigies was awoken by the dwarven wizard Tyadin.
