    Sithrak, The Hateful God, The All-Seeing Judge, and many more titles is generally known
    as the god of harsh judgement. Sithrak is generally worshiped by cruel judges, prosecutors,
    and other enforcers of law. He encourages harsh punishment for all the sins of the judged,
    and studying ones target so that you can truly punish them for their sins. Sithrak also
    created the mind flayers during the War of the Red King.

    Sithrak is the brother of Durn, the god of civilization. He and his brother agree on the
    need for law, but how they deal with the enforcement of it is where they differ. Sithrak
    enforces harsh punishments that are well beyond anything that Durn would consider acceptable.

    While Sithrak once lived with the other gods in Horgrverold, his cruel tendencies lead him
    to be exiled to <ap-link-button linkName="hell">Hell</ap-link-button> and given the duty of turning the empty, fiery plane into a prison for
    vile souls. As he worked, his flesh seperated from his bones, leaving him with a skeletal
    visage. He also put two spikes into his own eye sockets in order to bind the plane to his
    will, but traded his sight in return.

    Sithrak uses a vermilion red.
