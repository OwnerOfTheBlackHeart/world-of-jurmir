<h1>Hipha, Goddess of Technology and Knowledge</h1>
<p>
	Hipha is a relatively new god made during the revolution of digital technology.
	Originally intended to serve as a companion to the Clockwork God, Zigies, Hipha
	developed great power within her own right as access to communication networks
	and a forming intelligence slowly pushed her to preside over technology.
</p>
<p>
	Most worshipers of Hipha work with technology themselves, wether they be shipsmiths,
	IT people, mechanics, and more. Those that don't are almost always educators of
	some form, weather they be the professor-priests of the many school temples of Hipha 
	or software trainers teaching people how to use computers.
