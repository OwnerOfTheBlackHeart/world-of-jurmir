<h1>Fos, God of Community</h1>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>
	Fos was born Aaron Dobbs, the aasimar bard who would play a crucial roll in the	expansion of Lyrna
	across the entirety of its continent. His life is generally told as an epic where he collects those
	within society who have no place and purpose, organizing the irregular group into an effective
	scouting force that would, at the same time, weaken an area for conquest and solve major problems where
	he travelled.
</p>
<p>
	It is said that Aaron Dobbs became Fos after aiding in the organization and placation of monster races
	(orc, gnoll, and mountain lizardfolk), which has caused a lasting peace with such creatures in the
	continent of Lyrna.

<h1>The Brand Lord, God of Domination and Subjugation</h1>
<p>
	The Brand Lord is the name of Fos that the gnolls and drow use. While both agree that the Brand Lord 
	and Fos are the same being, they state that Fos will have nothing to do with the forced control of 
	another being, but when prayed to as the Brand Lord, he has occasionally offered a sliver of his 
	power of control and charisma to slavers and tyrants.
</p>
<p>
	The personal mark of a slave of the Brand Lord is a glowing hand print.
</p>
<p>
	While the gnolls and drow worship the Brand Lord in very similar manners, taking slaves frequently, 
	branding them within his churches and near his shrines, and occasionally offering slaves to the Brand 
	Lord, they differ in how the Brand Lord gifts them.
</p>
<p>
	To a gnoll a Brand Lord blessed brand is addicting and pleasurable. Once a blessed brand has been placed 
	on a slave, both the slaver and slave will feel pleasure whenever the slave obeys the slaver. Every 
	day that the slave goes without needing punishment, the effect grows stronger, but if the slaver fails 
	to punish the slave appropriately both can experience intense pain as the Brand Lord punishes them both.
</p>
<p>
	To a drow a Brand Lord blessed brand is little more than a tool for control and a way to please the Brand 
	Lord. The slave to whom the blessed brand is placed upon will always feel racking pain from the brand. 
	Should the slave obey, the brand's pain is reduced while failure to obey results in the brand becoming 
	more painful. If a drow with a slave with a blessed brand fails to command the slave enough, the slave will
	slowly gain the ability to control other slaves through blessed brands and more and more mental freedom. 
	Depending on the treatment of the slave, this can result in a loyal minion capable of commanding other 
	slaves or a dangerous revolutionary capable of disrupting entire great houses when the problem is left to fester.
</p>
<p>
	A gnollish blessed brand becomes whiter the more obedient the slave while a drow's becomes blacker the 
	more pain it inflicts onto the slave it is placed upon.
