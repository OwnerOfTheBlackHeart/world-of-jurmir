	Lagos was originally a Duskblade (and Eldrich Knight) Man that focused on timing and precision to an 
	obsessive degree. He stood 6 feet tall weighed 183lbs. Had olive colored skin and long matte black 
	dreds. He and a small party he traveled with stumbled upon the remains of the old god Chronos that 
	had crafted time. The aberrations that formed around the god killed most of the group but Lagos had 
	learned the movements and timing of the aberration that he killed many without incurring a single injury.
</p>
<p>
	Something stirred in the remains of the dead god Chronos as if seeing it from the past. Lagos gained 
	immense power slaying a seemingly endless horde. His habit of looking for timing had grown to seeing 
	the time itself. Slowing down and he sped up. At some points time even moved backwards for him. By 
	the time he finished off the enemies he was a god.
</p>
<p>
	Upon realizing he was the one controlling time he took control of the calendar and sun to form a 
	more routine and structured. Based it off the needs of mankind. At first he did it to make his life 
	easier to plan and more convenient.
</p>
<p>
	While the 2nd Time gods name was Chronos his fatherâ€™s name was Deus Ex Machina. The first god of time 
	was the first victim of the Red King seeking to end time. Unfortunately for the King Deus had already 
	given 90% of his power to a Successor an Elf by the name of Chronos. Chronos was slain by the less 
	villainous Zoltar in battle and his body left to rot under a mountain.
