<h1>Steele, Old God of the Dwarves</h1>
The old god that created the dwarves and the techniques for producing and using the metal steel.
He also was the lover and rival of the dragon goddess Kyranious.

The reason that Steele created steel was because he thought (insert god of earth here) was lazy,
so he gathered their elements and improved them.
