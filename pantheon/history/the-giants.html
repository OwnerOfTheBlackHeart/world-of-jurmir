<h1>The Story of the Giants and Goliaths</h1>
<p>
    During the creation of humans, the Red King created many failures. One of his failures was a creature now known as the Scorekeeper,
    a "human" that was weak of body and mind, yet impossible for the Red King to control. Rushed and mad, the Red King threw his creation
    into the tallest mountains on the material plane.
</p>
<p>
    Unbeknownst to the fighting gods and old gods, the Scorekeeper survived being thrown, only to grow stronger bones as a result. As he
    stood, the stones the Scorekeeper fell upon tore off chunks of his flesh, each producing a child of the giant species.
</p>
<p>
    Ignoring the children his flesh produced, the Scorekeeper jumped off a cliff, aiming to reach the other side, but he fell. The children
    watched in silence as the Scorekeeper hit the bottom of the valley between cliffs. To their surprise, the Scorekeeper rose from the ground
    and attempted to climb out of the valley. Each attempt to climb out of the valley, the Scorekeeper would fail and fall back down to the
    ground, rise up and try again, getting further up the cliff each time.
</p>
<p>
    When the Scorekeeper finally climbed out from the valley, his children had become adults, each staring in awe before their father. The
    smallest daughter of the Scorekeeper asked "Father, how did you learn to climb out of the valley?"
</p>
<p>
    "I did. And when I failed, I grew stronger. Then I did again and again until I could do what I couldn't before." Spoke the Scorekeeper in reply.
</p>
<p>
    Before his children could ask him more questions, the Scorekeeper jumped the cliff again, and once more fell to the bottom of the valley.
    Now, however, the Scorekeeper could climb his way out. And so he tried jumping the cliff again and again, each time jumping further until
    he could jump to the other side. As his children stared in awe, he beckoned them to join him.
</p>
<p>
    The largest son jumped from the cliff and, like the Scorekeeper, fell to the valley below. Only, the largest son died as he hit the ground.
    This stumped the Scorekeeper and he spent many years thinking of how to prevent his children from dying. Each idea being a failure, but each
    making him more and more aware of the limits of his children. Finally, after long enough that he had only the children of his childrens'
    children, the Scorekeeper stood up from his meditation.
</p>
<p>
    "Jump where you will not hurt yourselves. Climb where you will not hurt yourselves. Strengthen your arms and your legs and your bones until
    you can leap across the small valleys and climb the short cliffs. Then, practice on them until you can conquer larger valleys and higher cliffs,
    until you can jump the valley between us." Calmly shouted the Scorekeeper the children of his childrens' children.
</p>
<p>
    And they did so. Jumping progressively bigger valleys and climbing progressively taller cliffs, each growing stronger until they could join
    the Scorekeeper. As they did, the Scorekeeper noticed that the children of his childrens' children had changed. Their flesh turned white as
    ash and strange patterns formed from a mix of flesh and bone.
</p>
<p>
    "I name you, who have learned to conquer the mountains through leaps and climbs, goliaths. I grant you the peaks and the valleys." Said the 
    Scorekeeper before turning to a path down the mountain.
</p>
<p>
    Without another word, the Scorekeeper marched down the path. Most of the goliaths stayed in the mountains, eventually learning to jump from
    peak to peak, but some of them chose to follow the Scorekeeper as he marched down the mountain path.
</p>
<p>
    The path took the Scorekeeper to the peak of another mountain, one covered in ice and as colder than the coldest winter. Through the cold and
    the wind the Scorekeeper and his followers marched, ice forming on their bodies, muscles growing strong as they fought powerful winds and caught
    falling rocks. Eventually, the Scorekeeper grew tired of the falling rocks and climbed to the top of the mountain, where the rocks were falling
    from, his followers not far behind. As he picked up and threw the rocks, so too did his followers.
</p>
<p>
    When he had thrown all the rocks from the top of the frozen mountain, the Scorekeeper found that his followers had dressed themselves in skins
    and pelts and had become a pale blue. "I name you frost and for your size I shall call you giant. To you, I give the frozen peaks of the coldest
    mountains." Spoke the Scorekeeper to his followers.
</p>
<p>
    With his words spoken, the Scorekeeper turned to another mountain, whose bright red glow seemed as if a challenge to him. With a powerful leap,
    the Scorekeeper jumped towards his target, his followers splitting again, the frost giants staying on their frozen peaks while the others followed
    the first of their kind.
</p>
<p>
    The journey to the glowing mountain turned from cold to heat, the Scorekeeper and his followers enduring heat hotter than a blazing desert as they
    marched to the glowing mountain. Upon reaching the top, the Scorekeeper found a glowing red pool of liquid rock. Confident is his ability to handle
    the heat, the Scorekeeper jumped into the lava. His followers followed him in.
</p>
<p>
    When the Scorekeeper looked upon his followers, he noticed they had become black as char with hair as red as the lava his feet sank into. In the
    center of the chamber, the Scorekeeper announced "I shall call you the giants of fire and I grant you the mountains where rock flows as if it were
    water."
</p>
<p>
    With his words spoken, the Scorekeeper climbed out from the glowing mountain and marched down from the mountain. The journey was long as he walked
    over the flat earth, his steps causing the dirt and grass to flow out like waves, forming hills small and large. As the Scorekeeper breathed in the
    calm, clean air, he noticed a strong odor. Turning, he found his followers had become dull brown with shaggy brown hair and poorly cured furs donning
    their frames.
</p>
<p>
    "I name you ogres, and I grant you the valleys of the hills my steps create." Spoke the Scorekeeper before laying down at the top of one of the hills.
</p>
<p>
    What waited for the Scorekeeper when he woke from his slumber was ruddy brown with black hair, wearing poorly made and cared for hides, and adorned with
    massive bellies. "I name you giants of the hills and I grant you the tops of the hills, where you may rest your heads upon pillows of grass and dirt."
</p>
<p>
    Somewhat disgusted by the changes laziness brought, the Scorekeeper marched without aim, the hill giants too lazy to follow him, though many ogres joined
    in the aimless march. 
</p>
<p>
    After a long march, the Scorekeeper and his followers reached a thick patch of briers and thorny bush. The Scorekeeper went to jump over the patch, but fell
    into the center. His followers rushed in to pull him out, and when they all returned, their bodies had been torn to shreds by the briers and thorns. Undeterred,
    the Scorekeeper continued to jump, each time landing further into the patch, his followers enduring more and more injuries as they continued to retrieve the
    Scorekeeper from the patch.
</p>
<p>
    When the Scorekeeper had grown strong enough to leap to the other side of the briers and thorns, his followers simply walked through the patch unfazed. They had
    grown hunchbacked and green, with arms that dragged on the ground as they walked, the wounds the briers and thorns inflicted healing before the Scorekeepers eyes.
</p>
<p>
    "I shall name you trolls." The Scorekeeper said, looking around and finding an icy mountain behind him. "And I grant you the bases of frozen mountains, where you
    can grow your thorny bushes."
</p>
<p>
    Without pause, the Scorekeeper continued his march, his eyes now set upon a set of twin peaks. When he reached them, the Scorekeeper began jumping between them,
    climbing up after he had fallen and trying from the other mountain peak. As he leapt between the peaks, he learned that one was warm and frequently suffered great
    storms while the other reached so high as to pierce the clouds. It was as he leapt from the stormy peak to the obscured peak that he realized those that had followed
    him had become 2 peoples.
</p>
<p>
    To the quiet and self-reflective ones who endured storm after storm, the Scorekeeper said "I shall name you giants of the storm and grant you the windy, stormy mountains."
</p>
<p>
    To the cloud white and well dress ones that lived above the clouds, the Scorekeeper said "I shall name you giants of the clouds and grant you the mountains from which
    you will never see the ground below."
</p>
<p>
    As he walked down the cloud giants' mountain, the Scorekeeper noticed a motionless child with skin of stone staring at him. As he looked closer, the Scorekeeper found
    many more of the stone skinned ones, and to them he said "I shall call you giants of the stone, and grant you the mountains so rocky that no others will contest you
    for them."
</p>
<p>
    What happened after the Scorekeeper left the stone giants has been lost to time, as the ettins cared not to record events, even in story. The next time he was seen
    was when he had moved into Horgrverold, in a field of endless mountains, with the next always seeming to be taller and more treacherous than the last.
