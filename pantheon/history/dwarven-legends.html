<h1>Dwarven Legends</h1>

<h2>Wolgin the Anti-Beard</h2>
<p>
    Aye it be a legend from the days of Steele himself. Of a dwarf with the strength of the mountains and the craftsmanship that could make adamantine coppers in comparison
    Legend states that he will guide the dwarves under one banner

    But Wolgin's face doesn't grow a beard. Instead his hair grows up as if to consume the mountain above or even the skies.
