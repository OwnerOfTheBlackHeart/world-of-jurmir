<h1>The Story of the Drow and the Duergar</h1>
<p>
    Shortly after the gods had defeated the Red King and claimed humanity, Sithrak took a group of
    elves and a group of dwarves down into the underdark, where the Red King lay freshly sealed.
    He would place them as wardens of the underdark, turning their skin dark as coal and giving them
    sight in the dark, but also a touch of his cruelty and fury.
</p>
<p>
    Sithrak called the elves drow and the dwarves duergar, telling them that they would aid his mind
    flayers in the protection of the upperdark from the Red King. That they would help to keep the
    seal and that they would kill any creatures that came from the Void.
</p>
<p>
    As one last gift to the guardians he left, Sithrak filled the underdark with life. Giant mushrooms
    would feed the drow and the duergar while massive beasts would serve as protection and tools for
    them to fortify with. Some beasts would even be prey of the guardians, serving to feed them as well
    as keep them able to fight the beasts that would come from the Void.
</p>
<p>
    For a long time, this would be the status quo, but eventually Sithrak would find himself to be the
    warden of Hell, close to his creations once more. To the guardians he said "Now you must not only guard
    the cracks of the Void, but you must also guard the gates of Hell." The guardians would obey his
    command.
</p>
<p>
    With Sithrak so close, along with the constant tug of the Void and the corrupting influence of the
    escapies of Hell, Sithrak's guardians would become more and more cruel in their mission to keep the
    Red King trapped and the prisoners of Hell imprisoned. They even began sacrificing their own people
    to keep the seals on the void strong, but it would not be enough.
</p>
<p>
    Finding that as time went on the underdark became more and more dangerious, and the seals of the void
    weaker and weaker, the drow and the duergar turned to even more drastic measures. They began ubducting
    the children of the gods, the humans, dwarves, elves, and kobolds, to build their fortifications and
    to sacrifice to the seals of the Void.
</p>
<p>
    The slaves of the drow and duergar not only found themselves working on next to nothing in some of the
    worst conditions immaginable with constant risk of being chosen as the next sacrifice, but also of being
    sent out to kill the beasts of the underdark which, once meant to serve as food and labor, have become
    man eating monsters with little more than a thirst for destruction.
</p>
<p>
    Yet, dispite all this horror and warping, the drow, the duergar, and the mindflayers continue to guard
    the gates of Hell and the cracks in the Void, loyally serving Sithrak without the slightest hint of
    compassion or glory or honor.
