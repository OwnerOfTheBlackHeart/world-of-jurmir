<h1>The Story of the New Gods and of Humankind</h1>
<p>
    Man began during the War of the Red King.
</p>

<p>
    The Red King was the strongest god among the old gods, but grew jealous as the
    other gods formed their mortal children, the elves, the dragons, and the dwarves. 
    His jealousy lead the Red King to slay the first of the gods and eat his corpse.
</p>

<p>
    With the power gained from the consumption of the first god, the Red King began
    hunting down and eating the old gods like an animal. Eventually, Kyranious would
    survive an attack by the Red King and begin seeking the remains of the other old
    gods, using them to form the gods Durn, Sithrak and Kriotz.
</p>

<p>
    While Durn made the halflings, Sithrak the mind flayers, and Kriotz the gnomes,
    Kyranious forged the kobolds from the scales of her dragons to serve them in the
    coming battle. She also recruited Neerotan and his angels.
</p>

<p>
    When the Red King found this out, he recruited Zoltar and his demons to try and
    wipe out the new army forming. However, the speed at which the kobolds reproduced
    made them excellent at holding the demons of Zoltar off while the other races
    destroyed them. Seeing the loss, the Red King fled, leaving Zoltar behind to fight
    the other gods and their armies.
</p>

<p>
    Zoltar proved to be a great threat to the fresh gods, but was defeated as Neerotan
    forced himself to merge with Zoltar to create the god Zoltan, causing both the armies
    of angles and of demons to fall into chaos.
</p>

<p>
    Now without an army, but with inspiration, the Red King began forging his own race
    at last. Bald and pale, but quick to adapt and breed, this new race was built to
    be able to counter any beast it would fight. However, before the Red King could
    forge the race to be obedient to him, the remaining gods attacked, slaying the
    Red King.
</p>

<p>
    As he was slain, the Red King's corpse was placed in the Underdark and sealed away
    by Kriotz's own magic. While this was happening, Durn looked over the newly created
    race and saw them spreading at a wild rate. Seeing that they had not yet determined
    what they were, he named them humans and sent his halflings to be their guides.
</p>

<p>
    As the gods took to managing the worlds, the Red King reformed within his magical
    prison, The Void. In there he awaits the day that he will be able to break free and
    slay the gods and claim humanity as his own.
</p>

<p>
    The Red King looks like a disfigured, crimson red horned god with many eyes. Some
    depictions show him as a knight clad in crimson full plate with a massive, predatory
    maw filled with large, serrated teeth coming from underneath the helmet.
