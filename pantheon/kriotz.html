	Kriotz, Goddess of Magic, is one of the three gods created by Kyranious to fight the Red King.
	Of the three, Kriotz is the most intelligent, curious, and patient. She commands her followers
	to approach magic with caution and care, and to tame the natural chaos with great self control.
</p>
<p>
	Kriotz not only commands her devotees to carefully learn magic, but to also train new mages in
	how to appropriately use magic. The tenet of sharing the knowledge of magic is seconded in
	importance by the seeking of greater magical knowledge.
</p>
<p>
	While Kriotz is worshiped heavily by wizards and sorcerers, she is also considered the racial god of
	the high elves, which she took under her wing after trapping the Red King in the Void, and the gnomes,
	which she created.
</p>
<p>
	Temples to Kriotz are most commonly universities that are willing to teach the careful art of 
	wizardry and other careful approaches to magic, where prayers are arcane rituals which usually
	require four, or more, participants in order to properly utilize. These temples are generally
	advanced, with spell slot granting crystals and magical servants, but shun non-magical technology.

	Much to the dismay of Kriotz, her temple universities have had to began accepting technology,
	which she generally views as a lazy way to avoid magic, with one exception: Technomancers.
	Her temples mainly teach wizardry, magusry, and technomancy.
