also i am up for Lindo the Satyr Lich god of Death and Music
the first child of a god.

that got being Zoltan. Lindo was initially the music god but with the need for souls to be guided on 
lindo took on the responsibility of death as well. Lindo stands 8ft tall and has the fleshless head 
of a deer with a 10point rack. his favored weapon is the accordion

Lindo is a CG god who loves to entertain and play games. he often dresses in red plaids and with 
babbles hanging from his body. Lindo has been known to create various undead for personal amusement. 
Archons of Lindo are invariably bards of knowledge. beings who record and listen to the lives of the 
souls that pass through. Lg Ng Cg Ln are sent to the upper planes to be judged in Durns domain while 
N Cn Le Ne and Ce are sent to the lower plains to the judgement of Sithrak. Lindo can be appealed to 
directly by the later who if they can properly impress the Dead God they can appeal to serve as his 
Archon or even go back as an undead.
