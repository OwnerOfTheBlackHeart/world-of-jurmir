	Lindo the Cervitaur Lich god of Death and Music. The first child of a god. That god being Zoltan. 
	Lindo was initially the music god but with the need for souls to be guided on, Lindo took on the 
	responsibility of death as well. Lindo stands 8ft tall and has the fleshless head of a deer with a 
	10 point rack. His favored weapon is the accordion <i>(or if you must make my job harder I am fond of 
	the Scythe)</i>. Lindo is a god who loves to entertain and play games. He often dresses in red plaids 
	and with baubles hanging from his body. Lindo has been known to create various undead for personal 
	amusement. The Revenant is his personal favorite <i>(mostly from the tasty drama)</i>.
</p>
<p>
	Archons of Lindo are invariably bards of knowledge <i>(and liches)</i>. Beings who record and listen to the 
	lives of the souls that pass through. If a soul is particularly good or evil, Lindo will send them to 
	Horgverold or <ap-link-button linkName="hell">Hell</ap-link-button> respectively. Most souls, however, will spend some time in Dysvegr, awaiting the 
	gods to claim them. Lindo makes sure to catalog every soul that rides his boat to Dysvegr. Lindo has a 
	list of the clerics and the gods they belong to of which he express ships their souls to their patron 
	deities <i>(warlocks get sent to whoever they belonged to too)</i>. Lindo can be appealed to directly by the 
	later who if they can properly impress the Dead God <i>(which will take a lot)</i>, they can appeal to serve 
	as his Archon or even go back as an undead.
</p>
<p>
	Lindo runs the boat of the river Cain that carries souls to the afterlife. Lindo’s boat is magically 
	controlled by his accordion <i>(And it isn’t even limited by the river Cain)</i>. The river Cain ends in a 
	whirlpool that is as strong as the strife of the life of the person trying to enter it. This whirlpool 
	will allow the soul to reenter the materium. In order to be Reincarnated one must surf with Lindo to 
	the center. He only takes the sickest waves.
</p>
<p>
	Lindo has many children, but the most well known is his first child Feph, who he had with the human turned
	god Hrefna.
