Red Mothers (Queen, Princess, Lady) pregnancy
    At the start of the pregnancy, a Red Mother has a 50% chance of having a silent transformation or a slow transformation
        Silent transformations happen the moment the mother gives birth to her monsterious child
        Slow transformations begin within 2 months of submittion and often result in the start of a Cult of the Red King centered around the mother
    Use the pregnancy rules for determining if the birth is successful or not
        If a slow transformation, the mother may use her transformed form's stats
        A failed birth results in transformation into a lesser form

Children born of a Red Queen, Princess, or Lady acknowledge the Red King and any Red Nobility (Knight, Squire, and Page)
    Have view on the mortal servants that vary between tools and food
    While varied and unpredictable, they are typically called Red Decendents
    The rare child will be born as a Red Prince or a Red Princess
