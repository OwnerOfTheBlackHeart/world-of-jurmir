Red Mothers (Queen, Princess, Lady) pregnancy
    At the start of the pregnancy, a Red Mother has a 50% chance of having a silent transformation or a slow transformation
        Silent transformations happen the moment the mother gives birth to her monsterious child
        Slow transformations begin within 2 months of submittion and often result in the start of a Cult of the Red King centered around the mother
    Use the pregnancy rules for determining if the birth is successful or not
        If a slow transformation, the mother may use her transformed form's stats
        A failed birth results in transformation into a lesser form

Children born of a Red Queen, Princess, or Lady acknowledge the Red King and any Red Nobility (Knight, Squire, and Page)
