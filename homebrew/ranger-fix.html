<h2>Ranger Class Fix for 3.5</h2>
<ul class="homebrew-list">
    <li>
        Rangers start with a hunting companion. The hunting companion acts as a druid's
        animal companion with a druid level equal to the character's ranger level. This
        stacks with druid animal companion levels, up to the characters level.
    </li>
    <li>
        At character creation, rangers can choose one of two options:
        Sneak attack equal 1d6 as per the rogue class feature or the ranger can add 2 
        druid spells of every spell level he can cast to his spell list.
        <ul>
            <li>
                If the ranger has chosen the sneak attack option, it increases by 1d6 at
                levels 5, 10, 15 and 20. The sneak attack dice stack with sneak attack
                dice from rogues, up to a number of dice equal to half the character's
                level, rounded down.
