<h2>Ranger Class Fix for 3.5</h2>
<ul class="homebrew-list">
    <li>
        Rangers start with a hunting companion. The hunting companion acts as a druid's
        animal companion with a druid level equal to the character's ranger level. This
        stacks with druid animal companion levels, up to the characters level.
    </li>
    <li>
        At character creation, rangers can choose one of two options:
        Sneak attack equal to a fourth of their ranger level rounded up (stacks with rogue)
        or the ranger can add 2 druid spells of every spell level he can cast to his spell
        list.
    </li>
