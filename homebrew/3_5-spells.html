<p>
    A more powerful version of the Spectral Hand spell. On casting the spell, you lose 1d10 hit points that return when 
    the spell ends (even if it is dispelled), but not if the hand is destroyed. The hand's hit points are equal too the 
    amount lost. The spell gives you a +4 bonus on your melee touch attack roll and attacking with the hand counts as a 
    normal attack. The hand can also deliver touch attacks granted by racial or class abilities. If these attacks have 
    limited uses a day one use will be spend when it's delivered through the Greater Spectral Hand. Finally the Greater 
    Spectral Hand is able to wield weapons with the Ghost Touched property, it's attack bonus is the same as if the caster 
    was wielding the weapon. Otherwise the hand is the same as that of the Spectral Hand spell.
