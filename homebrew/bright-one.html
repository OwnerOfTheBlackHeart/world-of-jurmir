<h4>Class Features</h4>
<h5>Control (Su):</h5>
<p>
    A bright one can establish complete control over a creature, given enough time. Before doing
    so, a bright one must purchase 100gp of ground gemstones per hit die of the target creature(s).
    The ritual takes 1 hour to complete, after which all creatures affected by it are treated as
    if they are under a constant effect equivalent to the dominate class feature, except that if
    they succeed on their save versus a command they are immune to being commanded for 6 hours.
</p>
<p>
    A bright one can only control creatures they can use the dominate class feature on. Creatures
    that aren't friendly (see the diplomacy skill) with the bright one will rarely submit to a
    control ritual. The control ritual does not work on unwilling creatures.
</p>
<p>
    Creatures that have undergone a control ritual typically lose their coloring, appearing as
    pale with blonde to white hair and sun colored or white eyes.
</p>

<h5>Dominate (Su):</h5>
<p>
    A bright one can attempt to dominate a creature, taking control of it for a short time. 
    In order to dominate a creature a bright one must first make a touch attack. If the attack
    hits, the victim makes a will save. If the victim passes, they are stunned for one turn and 
    immune to domination for 24 hours. If they fail, they are under the control of the bright
    one for 1 minute. During this time they consider the bright one to be their ally and the
    bright one can use a move action to command the target, as per the suggestion
    spell with a DC equal to the bright one's dominate DC. Dominate can only affect humanoid 
    creatures.
</p>
<p>
    The save DC for dominate is 10 + 1/2 spellcasting class levels + charisma modifier. Dominate
    can be used a number of times per day equal to the bright one's class level plus their charisma
    modifier.
</p>
<p>
    When the control effects of dominate on a creature end, the bright one can attempt a diplomacy
    check to change the attitude of the target as if it were unfriendly.
</p>
<p>
    As a bright one grows in power, so does the range of creatures they can dominate and how they can
    dominate them. At level 2 they gain the ability to use dominate on monstrous humanoids. At level 4
    they gain the ability to use dominate on animals. At level 5 they can affect humanoids with the 
    effects of dominate person. At level 6 they can affect monstrous humanoids with the effects of 
    dominate person and gain the ability to dominate magical beasts. At level 7 they can inflict the 
    target with quest. At level 8 they gain the ability to use the dominate class feature on any creature.
    At level 9 they can affect all targets with the effects of dominate person.

so i know you are gonna say no to this but
what if aaron could convince people to worship him with his diplomacy. give him a touch attack that allows him to roll a diplomacy as a full round that enables him the chance to convince someone to join his side and add a ritual that could make the person permanitely subjugated (like all of aarons slave folk) and the result makes the person lose all of their malatin.
so like a black kobalt would turn into a pale grey one
someone who is already devoid of color could turn luminecent
the ring he is currently wearing could be something that stops him from beign able to do it

Just a couple of alterations: No touch attack. I really should give you more options to raise that wizard level so that it will be easier for you to pick up spells like control person or control monster, but for now fascinate or suggestion should be good enough to allow you to get the one minute you need to improve opinions.

The ritual should require the target to be friendly (in terms of what diplomacy allows), but this really just limits you to having to take an extra day or two of wait time as you have to chit chat good enough once a day to improve their opinion of Aaron.
And the sithrak ring would stop it, as I assume this ability would be one that comes solely from his pride
