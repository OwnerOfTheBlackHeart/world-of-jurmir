so i know you are gonna say no to this but
what if aaron could convince people to worship him with his diplomacy. give him a touch attack that allows him to roll a diplomacy as a full round that enables him the chance to convince someone to join his side and add a ritual that could make the person permanitely subjugated (like all of aarons slave folk) and the result makes the person lose all of their malatin.
so like a black kobalt would turn into a pale grey one
someone who is already devoid of color could turn luminecent
the ring he is currently wearing could be something that stops him from beign able to do it

Just a couple of alterations: No touch attack. I really should give you more options to raise that wizard level so that it will be easier for you to pick up spells like control person or control monster, but for now fascinate or suggestion should be good enough to allow you to get the one minute you need to improve opinions.

The ritual should require the target to be friendly (in terms of what diplomacy allows), but this really just limits you to having to take an extra day or two of wait time as you have to chit chat good enough once a day to improve their opinion of Aaron.
And the sithrak ring would stop it, as I assume this ability would be one that comes solely from his pride
