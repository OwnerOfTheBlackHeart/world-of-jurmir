<h4>Class Features</h4>
<h5>Control (Su):</h5>
<p>
    A bright one can establish complete control over a creature, given enough time. Before doing
    so, a bright one must purchase 100gp of ground gemstones per hit die of the target creature(s).
    The ritual takes 1 hour to complete, after which all creatures affected by it are treated as
    if they are under a constant effect equivalent to the Glowing Palm class feature, except that if
    they succeed on their save versus a command they are immune to being commanded for 6 hours.
</p>
<p>
    A bright one can only control creatures they can use the Glowing Palm class feature on. Creatures
    that aren't friendly (see the diplomacy skill) with the bright one will rarely submit to a
    control ritual. The control ritual does not work on unwilling creatures.
</p>
<p>
    Creatures that have undergone a control ritual typically lose their coloring, appearing as
    pale with blonde to white hair and sun colored or white eyes.
</p>

<h5>Glowing Palm (Su):</h5>
<p>
    A bright one can attempt to Glowing Palm a creature, taking control of it for a short time. 
    In order to Glowing Palm a creature a bright one must first make a touch attack. If the attack
    hits, the victim makes a will save. If the victim passes, they are stunned for one turn and 
    immune to domination for 24 hours. If they fail, they are under the control of the bright
    one for 1 minute. During this time they consider the bright one to be their ally and the
    bright one can use a move action to command the target, as per the suggestion
    spell with a DC equal to the bright one's Glowing Palm DC. Glowing Palm can only affect humanoid 
    creatures.
</p>
<p>
    The save DC for Glowing Palm is 10 + 1/2 spellcasting class levels + charisma modifier. Glowing Palm
    can be used a number of times per day equal to the bright one's class level plus their charisma
    modifier.
</p>
<p>
    When the control effects of Glowing Palm on a creature end, the bright one can attempt a diplomacy
    check to change the attitude of the target as if it were unfriendly.
</p>
<p>
    As a bright one grows in power, so does the range of creatures they can Glowing Palm and how they can
    Glowing Palm them. At level 2 they gain the ability to use Glowing Palm on monstrous humanoids. At level 4
    they gain the ability to use Glowing Palm on animals. At level 5 they can affect humanoids with the 
    effects of dominate person. At level 6 they can affect monstrous humanoids with the effects of 
    dominate person and gain the ability to Glowing Palm magical beasts. At level 7 they can inflict the 
    target with quest. At level 8 they gain the ability to use the Glowing Palm class feature on any creature.
    At level 9 they can affect all targets with the effects of dominate person.
</p>

<h5>Orb of Daylight (Su):</h5>
<p>
    Starting at 3rd level, when a bright one casts daylight (as a spell-like ability or spell, but not a daylight
    effect) they can choose to cast it as Orbs of Daylight. When cast as Orbs of Daylight, a number of orbs of light
    appear around the head of the bright one equal to the bright one's class level and last 1 minute per caster level.
    The bright one can expend one of these orbs to release a blast of light that blinds all creatures within 10 feet
    of the orb with a range of 30 feet and a DC equal to the Glowing Palm DC. So long as 1 orb remains, the bright 
    one is considered to be the center of the effects of a daylight spell. This effect lasts for 1 turn.
</p>
<p>
    Starting at 5th level, orb of daylight stuns instead of blinding and an orb of daylight can be launched as a 
    ranged touch attack dealing a number of d6s equal to the bright one's class level, which is usable for each 
    attack they have (+7 bab would get a +5 and a +2 attack before modifiers). The damage is counted as fire damage.
</p>
<p>
    Starting at 7th level, the bright one can use 3 orbs to deal the same damage as an orb of daylight strike, but 
    as an area attack equivalent to the range and area of fireball with a fort saving throw for half. The DC is 
    equal to the Glowing Palm DC.
</p>
<p>
    Starting at 10th level, the bright one can use 5 orbs to deal the same damage as an orb of daylight strike, but 
    as an area attack equivalent to the range and area of flame strike with a fort saving throw for half. The DC is 
    equal to the Glowing Palm DC. Half of the damage is considered divine damage and bypasses fire resistance and
    immunity. This use of orb of daylight strikes both the ethereal and the material at the same time, affecting 
    creatures on both normally.
