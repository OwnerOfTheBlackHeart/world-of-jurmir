<p>
    The guild Management system provided here is meant to handle allowing players
    to create and manage guilds while they still continue having the ability to
    adventure.

<h2>The Party</h2>
<p>
    The smallest deployable unit of a guild is the party, a group of 2 to 10 adventurers, 
    which is capable of taking on missions for the guild. The party is made up of its level
    and its members. Parties are typically assembled on the acceptance of a mission or the
    identification of a guild task.
</p>
<p>
    A party's level represents how capable the party is. A party's level is equal to the
    average level of the party's members.
</p>
<p>
    A party's members is the number of members in the party. Depending on the mission
    type, having a higher number of party members could be benificial or it could be
    counter productive.
</p>
<p>
    When building a party, pay attention to the types of members being chosen. Certain
    events can be reduced or negated by having certain types of characters in a party.
</p>

<h2>Guild Members</h2>
<p>
    A guild member represents a single adventurer working for the guild. They are the building
    blocks from which parties are assembled. They are the strength, the heart, the blood, and
    the soul of a guild. Each guild member is tracked as a level, experience score, and type.
</p>
<p>
    A guild member's level and experience are intertwined. The level represents the capacity
    of the individual guild member and the experience how far along to their next level they
    are. Guild members use the same experience chart as normal characters.
</p>
<p>
    A guild member's type represents what role the guild member plays. Combat members are focused
    and destroying enemies and surviving lethal blows. Stealth members focus on remaining unseen.
    Social members understand complex social structures and manipulate their way through them with
    ease. Divine members offer the blessings of the divines to a guild and provide healing as well
    as knowledge on religion and cults. Arcane members are in tune with the magic drawn from study or
    blood, and tend to be good at research. Natural members are one with nature, excelling at
    navigation, tracking, and surviving on their own.
</p>

<h3>Recruiting Guild Members</h3>
<p>
    A fresh faced guild member (level 1, 0 experience) can be recruited for 200gp. When a guild
    member is recruited in this manner, what type they are is randomly determined. For 300gp, you
    can recruit a level 1 character and choose what type they are.
</p>
<p>
    Higher level members may be recruited through roleplay or may be found during adventures. If 
    the characters can successful recruit the higher level member, they may be added by the GM with
    an appropriate level and type.
</p>

<h2>Missions</h2>
<p>
    A mission is the mode by which a guild gains profits and the members gain experience. Every
    mission has a success DC, required number of successes, travel time, activity time, reward,
    modifiers, and type.
</p>
<p>
    A mission's success DC is the difficulty check that the party has to roll against in order to
    gain a success. When a party fails to roll the DC or higher, they make a 
    <ap-link-button linkName="gms-consequences">consequence roll</ap-link-button>.
</p>
<p>
    A mission's number of success is how many successful rolls are required to successfully
    complete the mission.
</p>
<p>
    A mission's travel time is how long it takes for the party to get to the mission area and back.
    This value is added on to by the mission's activity time, which is added once for each mission 
    roll, pass or fail.
</p>
<p>
    A mission's reward is the amount of gold and the amount of experience earned upon successfully 
    completing the mission. The gold is the amount of gold pieces that the guild receives, while
    the experience is the amount of experience to be distributed among any guild members that
    participated in the mission.
</p>
<p>
    A mission's modifiers are the modifiers to the success roll based on certain effects of the
    party sent on it, such as including an arcane member or two combat members or even having
    less than four members in the party.
</p>
<p>
    A mission's type determines the <ap-link-button linkName="gms-consequences">consequence roll</ap-link-button> 
    chart used when a party fails to match or beat the mission's success DC.
</p>

<h3>Completing Missions</h3>
<p>
    A mission begins by selecting the party, or parties, that will handle the mission. When half
    the travel time has passed, the party may begin rolling mission rolls against the mission's
    success DC, each roll taking the mission's activity time. If a roll is failed, roll on the
    <ap-link-button linkName="gms-consequences">consequence roll</ap-link-button> table matching 
    the type of mission.
</p>
<p>
    If the party, or parties, gets a number of successes equal to mission's required successes,
    then the mission has been completed. Add the second half of the travel time and receive the
    gold and experience for completion of the mission. The members that worked on the mission
    are now freed to be added to new parties.
</p>

<h3>Failing a Mission</h3>
<p>
    Even though adventuring parties are typically considered to be fairly competent, they may still
    fail. A mission may fail under two conditions: The mission is time sensitive and time has run
    out or all guild members on the mission have died.
</p>
<p>
    When a mission is failed, the guild gains no reward, but any surviving members gain half experience.
