<h1>Town Building</h1>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<p>
	<i class="power">Goods:</i> Goods represent physical items necessary for an activity, which can be permanent fixtures or consumable items. For building an inn, 
	Goods are the materials used to build the structure, the tables and chairs, and the food and beverages you plan to sell. Goods as capital 
	are an abstraction so that you don’t need to keep track of gathering things like stones for a building’s foundation, timber for the walls, 
	ingredients for the menu, and so on. Goods might also represent natural resources (such as fertile soil or a spring), in which case you’re 
	not literally moving these items to a specific location — instead, you’re spending capital to acquire a location with those resources.
</p>
<p class="indent-1">
	<i class="power">Food:</i> A special subvariety of Goods, Food represents the raw food that feeds a community. Excess food is automatically converted to goods
	at a rate of 5 Food to 1 Good. 1 unit of Food feeds 10 population, rounding up. If you don't have enough Food income to feed your population generated, you lose 1 Goods per
	10 population, rounding up.
</p>
<p>
	<i class="power">Influence:</i> Influence represents your ability to get other people in the settlement to perform favors for you or use their skills to 
	accomplish things (as opposed to Labor, which involves hard physical work). This includes getting a merchant to change the terms of a contract, or convincing 
	a politician to do you a favor.
</p>
<p>
	<i class="power">Labor:</i> Labor represents using workers to accomplish tasks. This includes hiring carpenters to construct a building, hiring thugs to 
	extort shopkeepers, using assistants to help you craft items or tend injuries, or hiring employees to run your business while you’re away. For every 10 population
	that isn't working, 1 Labor is generated.
</p>
<p>
	<i class="power">Magic:</i> Magic represents magical power at your disposal. Some activities, such as healing sick peasants in the slums or constructing a 
	magical library, specifically require you to spend Magic.
</p>

<h3 id="purchasing-resources">Purchasing Resources</h3>
<p>
	Resources can be purchased with gold, which is more expensive than building up the resources over time. When purchasing resources, you gain the resources
	immediately. This may represent paying carpenters from the next settlement over to help bolster your own carpenters, or it might represent buying the wood
	from another barony.
</p>
<p>
	The prices listed in the table above represent the cost of buying one unit of resources. Excess Goods, Labor and Magic can be sold for profit, at a return
	of half their purchase cost.
</p>

<h3 id="earning-resources">Earning Resources</h3>
<p>
	Resources can be passively earned over time by buildings or improvements that are manned, once per month. Buildings that are not manned do not produce
	resources.
</p>

<p>
	Combatants range in level from 1st to 12th, with minors being 1st to 3rd, mediums being 4th to 6th, majors being 7th to 9th, and heroics being
	10th to 12th. Within each combatant category, there is 5 lower level combatants for each level higher. For example, if you have 12 Combatant, minors, then you have
	10 at level 1 and 2 at level 2. You would get your first level 3 once you have 31 combatant, minors, which would be 25 at level 1, 5 at level 2, and 1 at level 3.

</p>

<h3 id="mansion">Mansion</h3>
<p>
	A mansion is a large, non-fortified home intended to serve as the residence of important, wealthy or powerful members of a settlement.
	A mansion is typically 2 to 3 stories tall with 10 to 20 rooms. This often includes a library/office combo, a dance hall, a social room,
	a living room, a large interior kitchen, a personal armory (if appropriate), and servants' bedrooms.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Effect:</b> A mansion can house up to 2 trained, arcane, divine, or combatant (major and heroic) population as well as up to 5
	combatant (minor and medium) and 10 untrained population. In order to house an arcane, combatant (major) or combatant (heroic), the 10
	untrained population housed in the mansion work in the mansion.
</p>
<p>
	If a mansion is worked by the 10 untrained population, then each of the trained, arcane, divine, or combatant (major and heroic) population
	living in the mansion generates 1 influence.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Cost:</b> 50 labor, 150 goods
</p>

<h3 id="keep">Keep</h3>
<p>
	A keep is a fortified home designed to keep a person, or family, safe from attack. Most keeps can also protect the residents of nearby homes,
    and may serve as the main defensive fortification of settlements too small to warrant a full castle. Most keeps are made of stone with 15 to
    25 rooms over 1 to 4 stories. Most keeps include all the same rooms as a mansion, along with a barracks and a dungeon, as they are usually 
    the home of a settlement's mayor.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Effect:</b> A keep can hold up to 2 trained, arcane, divine, or combatant (major and heroic) population as well as up to 15 combatant 
    (minor and medium) and 10 untrained population. In order to house an arcane, combatant (major) or combatant (heroic), the 10 untrained 
    population housed in the keep work in the keep. 
</p>
<p>
    If a keep is worked by the 10 untrained population, then each of the trained, arcane, divine, or combatant (major and heroic) population 
    living in the keep generates 1 influence. If at least 5 of the combatant (minor or medium) population work as guards of the building, it
    generates 1 more influence.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Cost:</b> 60 labor, 175 goods, 5 influence
</p>

<h3 id="town-wall">Town Wall</h3>
<p>
	A town wall protects buildings within the town itself and serves as a means for the settlement to prevent attackers from getting into the settlement.
    Most town walls offer a gate connected to every major road that runs through the settlement. While they can be built of wood and dirt, most town walls
    are made of stone. In case of attack, nearby farmers retreat into the settlement and the gates are closed.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Effect:</b> A town wall prevents attacks from typical raiders, bandits and other attackers. Prepared enemies may be able to get around, or through,
    the wall, though it usually still impedes them considerably. Flying creatures, such as dragons, are not stopped by a town wall.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Cost:</b> 30 labor, 100 goods
</p>

<h3 id="castle">Castle</h3>
<p>
	A castle is made up of a keep surrounded by a wall with 4 towers that serves as a residence for nobility. Castles for greater nobility will usually have
    more building added within the castle's walls, usually for the private use of the noble(s) that reside within the castle.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Effect:</b> A castle grants all of the same benefits of a keep and a town wall, though the wall only protects up to 10 more buildings, which may be any
    building excluding large farms or ports. Arcane schools, markets, mansions, keeps and small farms count as 2 buildings. A castle built within a settlement
    is often even harder to assault that a castle is normally, due to the difficulty of moving siege equipment through the crowded streets.
</p>
<p>
    When a castle is actively used, it generates 2 influence (on top of that generated by the keep).
</p>
<p>
	<b>Cost:</b> 75 labor, 225 goods, 10 influence
</p>

<h3 id="small-farm">Small Farm</h3>
<p>
	A small farm is the size of farm that would typically be worked by a family with at 3 working bodies (typically a father and 2 sons, 
	or a father, mother, and son). This assumes that the 3 persons are given as much land as they can work, rather than as much as they
	need to feed themselves.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Effect:</b> When worked by 3 untrained population a small farm produces 1 food.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Cost:</b> 1 labor, 1 goods
</p>

<h3 id="large-farm">Large Farm</h3>
<p>
	A large farm is typical of a lord's private fields, taking multiple families to operate.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Effect:</b> When worked by 10 untrained workers a large farm produces 4 food.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Cost:</b> 10 labor, 5 goods
</p>

<h3 id="smithy">Smithy</h3>
<p>
	A small forge and warehouse built to allow the smithing of metal, smithies are vital to most settlements for the production of nails, horseshoes and
    tools, as well as their repair. 
</p>
<p>
	<b>Effect:</b> When worked by 1 trained population, a smithy produces 1 goods.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Cost:</b> 15 labor, 8 goods
</p>

<h3 id="port">Port</h3>
<p>
	Ports allow the import and export of goods along waterways, such as rivers, lakes, seas and oceans. Ports usually come with warehouses for the storage of
    goods and a dock master.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Effect:</b> When worked by 5 untrained population, ports produce 1 goods or 1 influence. For every 4 ports, a dry dock is built. When worked by 1 trained
    and 10 untrained population, dry docks produce 3 goods.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Cost:</b> 10 labor, 8 goods
</p>

<h3 id="lumbermill">Lumbermill</h3>
<p>
	Lumbermills are large buildings dedicated to the processing of raw lumber, splitting it into planks or quarters. Lumbermills require access to forests within
    10 miles of the settlement.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Effect:</b> When worked by 1 trained and 3 untrained population, a lumbermill produces 2 goods.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Cost:</b> 20 labor, 15 goods
</p>

<h3 id="mine">Mine</h3>
<p>
	Used for pulling raw ore, coal and/or stone from the ground, mines are an invaluable resource to settlements.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Effect:</b> When worked by 1 trained and 10 untrained population, a mine produces 2 goods or 1 influence. If the settlement has a smithy, the mine can be
    assigned to the smithy, causing it to produce 1 more goods, in addition to the production of both the mine and the smithy. Each mine can be assigned to only
    one smithy and each smithy can only be supported by up to 2 mines.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Cost:</b> 30 labor, 5 goods
</p>

<h3 id="market">Market</h3>
<p>
	The heart of most settlements is the market, where people can go to buy and sell what their goods.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Effect:</b> When worked by up to 6 trained population, the market produces 1 influence per 2 population assigned.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Cost:</b> 10 labor, 20 goods
