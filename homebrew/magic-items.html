<h3>The Singing Blade</h3>
<p>
    The Singing Blade is a +1 rapier that, when drawn, grants an extra +1 bonus to the wielder's
    inspire courage ability. When a character wielding the Singing Blade is under the effects of
    inspire courage, whether their own or from another bard, they may use charisma in place of
    strength for attack and damage rolls.

    The Singing Blade was a weapon used by the ancient bard Tii Loveletter, who is said to have
    created the first half dragon. Through the bards many travels and constant use of magical
    music, the blade that rested in his hand became imbued with power. Now, when exposed to magical
    song, the blade begins to vibrate and make complementary tones, earning it the name the
    Singing Blade.
