<h1>Gem Enchanting Alternate Enchanting System</h1>
<p>
    A gem enchantment slot counts as +1 enchantment when determining the cost of upgrading
    the item. So upgrading a +1 longsword with 1 gem enchantment by +1, to a +2 longsword,
    would cost 18,000gp.
</p>
<p>
    Adding a gem enchantment to a magic item is the same as adding a +1 bonus to the item,
    except that it costs 500gp less. So, enchanting a +2 sword with 2 more gem slots would
    cost 49,000gp and take 49 days.
</p>
<p>
    An item with gem enchantment can accept magic gems containing compatable enchantments
    (like +1 or burning on a weapon or shadow on armor), so long as the item has enough
    free gem enchantments. A magic gem takes up as many gem enchantments as the bonus modifier.
    Changing magic gems takes 24 hours to reattune, but only takes 1 minute to physically swap
    per gem.
</p>
<p>
    All magic gems cost at least 500gp. Each enchantment bonus that an enchantment costs
    costs 500gp. Magic gems that are based on enchantments that have a gold cost cost the 
    same as the enchantment.
</p>
<p>
    If a magic gem is for an enchantment that doesn't have an enchantment bonus cost only
    require that the magic item they are being installed into has at least 1 gem enchantment
    slot, but does not require it to be free.
