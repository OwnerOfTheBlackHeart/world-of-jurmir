<h1>Downtime Training</h1>
<p>
	The classes of D&D 3.5 and Pathfinder account for, to an extent, the skills that adventurers learn over their journeys, but it only
	covers skills that the adventurers learn during the unseen spaces while they are travelling through the wilderness, relaxing at taverns,
	or just relaxing in town, but what about when adventurers dedicate large periods of downtime to training something specific? That is
	the question downtime training seeks to answer.
</p>

<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>
	When a character uses downtime training to learn a skill, they start with ensuring that they have 1 week to handle seeking mentors,
	researching, and practicing the new skill, as well as 10gp times the new skill rank they are seeking, to pay for a mentor's time,
	classes (if one is near an institution that offers such), and practice materials.
</p>
<p>
	After paying the time and gold for learning the new skill, the character will make a knowledge (student, int) or a profession (student,
	wis) check with a DC equal to 15 plus the current skill rank. If the character succeeds this check, then they gain 1 rank in the skill
	they were training. If they fail, they may try again the next week at 5gp times the new skill rank.
</p>
<p>
	Downtime training skills doesn't allow a character to reach more than double the skill points they normally would have. If a character
	wishes to use downtime training for a skill and is at double the skill points they would normally have, they may reduce another skill
	by 1 rank, to represent their neglect of the skill.

<h3>Knowledge (student, int)</h3>
<p>
	Knowledge (student) covers academic practices, organizations, processes and rules as well as major figures in academic circles.
</p>

<h3>Profession (student, wis)</h3>
<p>
	Profession (student) represents the practical application of academic skills, such as writing papers, optimizing entrance paperwork,
	and study skills.
