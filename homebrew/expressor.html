<h4>Class Features</h4>
<h5>Birth Outsider (Sp):</h5>
<p>
	The expressor gains the ability to perform a ritual that impregnates a victim with an outsider.
	The ritual requires that the victim be willing or helpless and have the ability to normally give birth. The 
	expressor selects an outsider with no more adjusted hit dice (see last paragraph) than the number of expressor levels 
	they have (counting base class levels), then purchases 100gp worth of materials per hit die of the target 
	outsider, which are then used up during the ritual. The ritual takes 24 hours of work, during which the
	expressor and the victim commune with the appropriate planar forces. At the end of the 24 hours, the victim is
	impregnated. 
</p>
<p>
	The pregnancy is a 3 month pregnancy following the rules outlined in the 
	<ap-link-button linkName="pregnancy">pregnancy rules</ap-link-button>. If the outsider is 2, or more, size 
	categories smaller than the mother, it is born full sized. Otherwise, the outsider is born 2 size categories
	smaller than the mother and grows to its normal size over a 1 week growth period.
</p>
<p>
	When the outsider created by birth outsider is born, the expressor may choose, so long as they
	are on the same plane as the outsider, to command it via rebuke outsider. The new-born outsider gets
	no save against this effect. If the outsider is not commanded, it will be indifferent to its mother and 
	friendly to its creator (as per diplomacy). The outsider normally goes off on its own after birth if not
	commanded. An outsider that cannot normally be commanded by rebuke/command outsider will instead be indifferent
	to its creator, as per the diplomacy skill.
</p>
<p>
	The expressor can use birth outsider on themself. If the expressor lacks a womb and performs
	birth outsider on themself, they are turned into one of the following sexes (their choice): Female, masculine
	hermaphrodite or feminine hermaphrodite.
</p>
<p>
	An outsider's adjusted hit dice is equal to its challenge rating + 2 or its hit dice, whichever is higher.
</p>

<h5>Rebuke/Command Outsider:</h5>
<p>
	If an expressor has the ability to rebuke/command undead, they gain the ability to rebuke/command outsiders. An expressor can only command
	outsiders that are within 1 step on the alignment scale. An outsider's hit dice for the sake of rebuke/command outsider is 
	equal to its challenge rating + 2 or its hit dice, whichever is higher.
</p>

	the expressor must start a grapple, which provokes an attack of opportunity (unless the expressor possesses the Improved Grapple feat). 
	On a success, draining kiss deals 1d6 damage plus the casting stat modifier	of the base class. The expressor then heals the amount of 
	damage dealt, up to the expressor's maximum hit points.
</p>

<p>
	Starting at 10th level, the expressor can choose to bestow a negative level in place of the damage of draining kiss. The fortitude save
	DC for removing the negative level is equal to DC of 10 + half the expressor's caster level + the expressor's casting stat.
