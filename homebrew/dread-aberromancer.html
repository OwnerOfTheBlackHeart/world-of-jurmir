<h4>Class Features</h4>
<h5>Extended Spell List:</h5>
<p>
	The dread aberromancer gains access to a new set of spells: Summon aberration. Summon aberration ranges
	from 3rd level (summon aberration III) to 9th level (summon aberration IX) and higher level summon aberration
	spells can summon groups of aberrations of a lower level the same way higher levels of summon monster can
	summon groups of monsters of a lower level.
</p>

</p>

	Half-Troll (FF) or Woodling (MM3).
</p>

<h5>Birth Aberration (Sp):</h5>
<p>
	The dread aberromancer gains the ability to perform a ritual that impregnates a victim with an aberration.
	The ritual requires that the victim be willing or helpless and have the ability to normally give birth. The 
	dread aberromancer selects an aberration with no more hit dice than the number of dread aberromancer levels 
	they have (counting base class levels), then purchases 100gp worth of materials per hit die of the target 
	aberration, which are then used up during the ritual. The ritual takes 24 hours of work, during which the
	dread aberromancer and the victim commune with the Red King. At the end of the 24 hours, the victim is
	impregnated. 
</p>
<p>
	The pregnancy is a 3 month pregnancy following the rules outlined in the 
	<ap-link-button linkName="pregnancy">pregnancy rules</ap-link-button>. If the aberration is 2, or more, size 
	categories smaller than the mother, it is born full sized. Else wise, the aberration is born 2 size categories
	smaller than the mother and grows to its normal size over a 1 week growth period.
</p>
<p>
	When the aberration created by birth aberration is born, the dread aberromancer may choose, so long as they
	are on the same plane as the aberration, to command it via rebuke aberration. The new-born aberration gets
	no save against this effect. If the aberration is not commanded, it will be indifferent to its mother and 
	friendly to its creator (as per diplomacy). The aberration normally goes off on its own after birth if not
	commanded.
</p>
<p>
	The dread aberromancer can use birth aberration on themself. If the dread aberromancer lacks a womb and performs
	birth aberration on themself, they are turned into one of the following sexes (their choice): Female, masculine
	hermaphrodite or feminine hermaphrodite.
</p>

<h5>Rebuke Aberration / Ooze (Su):</h5>
<p>
	The dread aberromancer can rebuke and command aberrations as an evil cleric rebukes and commands undead.
</p>
<p>
	At 5th level, the dread aberromancer can also rebuke and command oozes.
</p>

<h5>Mimic Armor (Ex):</h5>
<p>
	At 2nd level, the dread aberromancer gains the ability to use birth aberration to create a special mimic. This
	mimic is automatically commanded by the dread aberromancer and does not count towards their hit dice of commanded
	creatures. This mimic has the same number of hit dice as the dread aberromancer and is the same size category
	as the dread aberromancer.
</p>
<p>
	This mimic has the ability to become light armor, attaching itself to the dread aberromancer, which takes a full action
	from both the mimic and the dread aberromancer. The mimic grants the dread aberromancer an armor bonus of +3, a
	max dex of 7, and an armor check penalty of -1. The mimic cannot be worn over armor, counts as armor, but has an arcane
	spell failure chance of 0%. When being used as armor, the mimic cannot take its own actions. A dread aberromancer is
	always considered proficient with their mimic armor.
</p>
<p>
	As a full round action, a dread aberromancer who is wearing their mimic armor can detach their mimic armor and have
	it attempt to restrain an enemy within 20ft, who is no more than 1 size category larger than the dread aberromancer.
	The mimic attempts a grapple check against the target. If the mimic is successful, any creature of the same size, or
	smaller, is rendered helpless by the mimic completely surrounding them. If the creature is larger than the armor mimic,
	then they are pinned as the mimic takes hold of their lower half. The target can attempt another grapple to escape
	each round.
</p>
<p>
	If the mimic armor has any feats that affect the use of armor, such as Adjusted to Armor, then the dread aberromancer
	gains the benefits of these feats while wearing the mimic armor. For the sake of meeting feat prerequisites, mimic armor
	mimics count half their hit dice as fighter levels.
</p>
<p>
	Mimic armors count as masterwork armor and can be enchanted as armor, but they only gain the benefits of such enchantments
	while being used as armor. Mimic armors cannot be sold, as they are clearly living upon close inspection. Mimic armors can
	be upgraded with the effects of adamantine by feeding it 10,000gp worth of adamantine. It can also be upgraded with the
	effects of mithral by feeding it 4,000gp worth of mithral.
</p>
<p>
	At 5th level, the mimic can become medium armor, granting an armor bonus of 5, a max dex of 5 and an armor check 
	penalty of 3.
</p>
<p>
	At 9th level, the mimic can become heavy armor, granting an armor bonus of 7, a max dex of 3 and an armor check
	penalty of 5.
</p>

<h5>Draining Touch (Su):</h5>
<p>
	Starting at 2nd level, a dread aberromancer can use a standard action to sap the vitality of a target. The dread aberromancer
	makes a melee touch attack against the target. On a success, draining touch deals 1d6 damage plus the casting stat modifier
	of the base class. The dread aberromancer can then heal a living creature of their choosing within 60 feet by the amount of damage
	they dealt.
</p>
<p>
	The damage of draining touch increases to 2d6 at 5th level, 3d6 at 8th level, and 4d6 at 10th level.
</p>

<h5>Disguise Self (Sp):</h5>
<p>
	At 3rd level, a dread aberromancer gains the ability to cast Disguise Self as an at will spell-like ability. The casting level
	is equal to the dread aberromancer’s caster level and the casting ability score is the same as the base classes casting ability
	score.
</p>

<h5>Energy Resistance (Su):</h5>
<p>
	At 3rd level, a dread aberromancer gains energy resistance (fire 10). At 4th, she gains energy resistance (acid 10).
	At 6th, she gains energy resistance (cold 10). At 7th level, she gains immunity to poison (as per the venom immunity druid class
	feature). At 10th level, she gains immunity to the electricity damage type.
</p>

<h5>False Alignment (Su):</h5>
<p>
	At 4th level, a dread aberromancer gains the ability to disguise their alignment on the good vs evil spectrum as being good.
	The DC to see their true alignment is 10 plus half their dread aberromancer caster level plus the modifier for the dread aberromancer’s
	casting ability score.
</p>
<p>
	At 8th level, a dread aberromancer gains the ability to use False Alignment to disguise themself as neutral on the good vs evil
	alignment spectrum.
</p>

<h5>Create Ooze (Ex):</h5>
<p>
	At 6th level, a dread aberromancer gains the ability to use birth aberration to create oozes and use rebuke aberration against
	oozes. Oozes created with birth aberration don't produce acid until they are 1 day old. If the dread aberromancer controls an
	ooze, they can command it to stop producing acid. The ooze is clean enough to pick up after 1 hour and takes 1 hour to rebuild
	its acid coating once commanded to.
</p>
<p>
	The dread aberromancer also gains the ability to improve her mimic armor. She does so by using birth aberration to create an
	ooze of her choice. After the ooze is born, her mimic armor consumes the ooze and gains the acid ability of the ooze with a
	constitution based DC.
</p>

<h5>Alter Self (Sp):</h5>
<p>
	At 7th level, a dread aberromancer gains the ability to cast Alter Self as an at will spell-like ability. The casting level
	is equal to the dread aberromancer’s caster level and the casting ability score is the same as the base classes casting ability
	score.
</p>

<h5>Tongues (Su):</h5>
<p>
	At 8th level, a dread aberromancer gains the effects of the spell Tongues as a constant supernatural ability.
</p>

<h5>Telepathy (Su):</h5>
<p>
	At 9th level, a dread aberromancer gains the Telepathy special ability with a range of 100ft.
