<h1>Lesser Drow</h1>
<p>
	Lesser drow is a concept introduced in the book Player's Guide to Faerun on page 191 as a means to play drow
	without level adjustment. While I like the concept, the execution of it was, in my opinion, lackluster. So,
	here is my proposed version of the lesser drow for use within the World of Jurmir setting.
</p>
<p>
	These traits are in <b>addition</b> to the high elf traits, except where noted.
</p>

<h2>Lesser Drow</h2>
<ul class="list">
    <li><b>Darkvision/Low Light Vision:</b> Darkvision 120ft, replaces low light vision</li>
    <li>
		<b>Automatic Languages:</b> Common, Elven, Undercommon 
		<b>Bonus Languages:</b> Abyssal, Aquan, Draconic, Drow Sign Language, Gnome, Goblin. 
		This trait replaces the high elf’s automatic and bonus languages.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Weapon Proficiency:</b> A drow is automatically proficient with the hand crossbow, the rapier, and the short sword. 
		This trait replaces the high elf’s weapon proficiency.
	</li>
    <li><b>Favored Class:</b> Wizard (male) or Cleric (female)</li>
    <li><b>Special Qualities:</b> Light Blindness, Spell-Like Abilities</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<b class="power">Light Blindness:</b> Abrupt exposure to bright light (such as sunlight or a daylight spell) blinds drow for 1 round. 
	On subsequent rounds, they are dazzled as long as they remain in the affected area.
</p>
<p>
	<b class="power">Spell-Like Abilities:</b> Drow can use the following spell-like abilities once per day: dancing lights, darkness,
	faerie fire. Caster level equals the drow’s class levels.
