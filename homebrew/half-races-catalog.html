<h1>Half-Races Catalog</h1>
<h2>Powerful Build (Ex)</h2>
<p>
    The physical stature of the half-breed lets them function in many ways as if they were one size category larger. 
    Whenever a half-breed is subject to a size modifier or special size modifier for an opposed check (such as during 
    grapple checks, bull rush attempts, and trip attempts), the half-breed is treated as one size larger if doing so 
    is advantageous to him. A half-breed is also considered to be one size larger when determining whether a creature’s 
    special attacks based on size (such as improved grab or swallow whole) can affect him. A half-breed can use weapons 
    designed for a creature one size larger without penalty. However, his space and reach remain those of a creature of 
    his actual size. The benefits of this racial trait stack with the effects of powers, abilities, and spells that change 
    the subject’s size category.
