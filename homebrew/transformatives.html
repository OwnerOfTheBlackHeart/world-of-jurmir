<h1>Transformatives Potions</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	Transformatives are a special type of permanent potion that produce purely cosmetic changes.
	These changes are fairly specific and don't offer significant enough alterations to allow a
	character to use them as a means of appearing as a specific person, though enough transformatives
	can make a character unrecognizable as their former self.
</p>
<p>
	Transformatives come in two types: Alchemical and magical. Alchemical transformatives tend to
	have milder affects than magical transformatives, take 1 day for the effect to manifest, and are 
	created using the standard rules for creating alchemical items. Magical transformatives are stronger 
	than alchemical transformatives, take effect within one minute and use the rules for creating potions. 
	All transformatives weight one tenth of a pound.
</p>
<p>
	If a player is looking to use transformatives to attempt to disguise themselves as another person,
	they might be able to get close enough that those unfamiliar with the intended disguise might mistake
	them for the intended disguise, but anyone familiar enough with the intended to know their face
	will see through the disguise if other measures aren't taken.
</p>
<p>
	Most characters (player or NPC) are going to use transformatives for one of two purposes: To 
	modify their appearance to what they find attractive or to take on a completely different appearance,
	whether for hiding or to start life anew.
</p>
<p>
	For the rest of this document, the character that drinks, or has applied, the Transformative is
	referred to as the imbiber.

</p>
<p>
	When rubbed over the entire body, flesh tone oil slowly alters the imbiber's skin color to that of the flesh tone oil. Flesh
	tone oil can be used to give the imbiber unnatural skin colors, such as blue or purple. When used on a creature that is covered
	in scales, then the flesh tone oil color applies to the scales. When used on a creature with both scales and exposed flesh, the
	creature applying flesh tone oil can rub the oil on the skin, the scales, or both.

	be one color with the other side being another color.
</p>

	carefully dripped onto the eyeball(s) to be affected. Once applied, the imbiber's eyes slowly become the color of the colored
	eye drops. Much like permanent hair dye, colored eye drops only affect the eye(s) which they are applied to and some imbibers
	have used them to create heterochromatic eyes.
</p>

<h3>Giant's Milk</h3>
<p>
	This vial contains a milky fluid with a grayish tint. Once the imbiber drinks the milk, they gain 1d3 inches of height. If
	the weight of the imbiber is tracked, then the imbiber gains weight according to the weight modifier they rolled during rolling
	the vital statistics. If the imbiber doesn't know what they rolled during the vital statistics, roll the weight roll again and
	apply it to the gained inch(es) of height.

	have a weight less than the minimum for their race (before height modifiers).
</p>

<h3>Metabolic Reducer</h3>
<p>
	This vial contains a thick, fatty fluid that has a savory and salty flavor. Upon drinking the reducer, the imbiber gains a number of
	pounds equal to 1 per inch above the minimum height for their race and sex. Metabolic reducer cannot make an imbiber weight more than
	the minimum weight plus double the maximum rollable weight modifier. For example, the max weight a male elf can achieve through
	metabolic reducer is 12 (max height roll) times 6 (max weight modifier) times 2 plus 85 (base weight), for a max weight of 229 lbs.
</p>

<p>
	This vial contains an oil whose vibrant colors are constantly shifting. Upon being rubbed with the contents of the vial, the imbiber
	rerolls their sex roll (male, female, etc.), their height and weight, and their sexual characteristics. If charts exist for their
	hair and eye color, then roll those as well. If no charts exist, the GM and a person other than the applier and applicant decide on
	a new hair and eye color after rolling a d6. If 1 through 4, the colors are natural colors, if 5 or 6, at least one of the colors are 
	unnatural.
